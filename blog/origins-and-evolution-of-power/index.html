        <section class="body"><p>Even though I rarely write about such topics, right now it is November 2024. This year is
an <em>important year</em> – there were many elections around the world, in countries that still
care enough to go through the motions of that thing we call “democracy”. This month is an
<em>important month</em> – this month, the United States might vote for possibly the last time. So
I will use this opportunity to collect some of my thoughts about political power.</p>
<p>Now I personally do not care too much about the United States, but this election might be
of strong symbolic importance by marking a global state transition (pun intended),
regardless of the outcome. As an European, for better or for worse, I have been living all
my life in the backwaters and shadow of this currently still dominating, but falling
empire. The world at large seems to move away from the hegemony of the US, which for the
last more than 50 years exported a specific combination of free-market capitalism and
liberal democracy into the world, with mixed success. The loose collection of nation
states which are called “The West” is currently in an existential crisis caused by
multiple external and internal pressures. Many of these countries are increasingly turning
away from and burying democracy, in order to reorganize themselves into structures with
a higher concentration of power.</p>
<p>Just like in old times, power these days is almost fully soaked up and gathered in the
hands of various individual “leaders” – be it autocrats, oligarchs or both at the same
time. But what actually <em>is</em> “power”? How does it work? The words we use change, and
often obfuscate the view, but the essence and mechanisms remain the same. So trying to
make sense of the concept, finding some answers to such questions from a high-level
perspective, strongly infused with personal opinion, shaped by reading a lot of
news<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-junkie-1"><a href="#fn-junkie">[1]</a></sup> and slightly sprinkled with ideas from complexity science and dynamical
systems, is what this long-winded and sometimes rambling article is all about. If you have
not been properly discouraged by this description, I hope that you will enjoy the ride.</p>
<h2 id="the-evolutionary-origins-of-power-dynamics"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#the-evolutionary-origins-of-power-dynamics" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-evolutionary-origins-of-power-dynamics"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
The Evolutionary Origins of Power Dynamics</h2>
<p>Let us start with a few definitions. I promise that it will not continue <em>that</em> dry, but I
think it is good to at least roughly clarify terms first. <strong>Political power is access to
and control of any resource that allows an agent to effectively project change into the
world</strong>, overcoming eventual resistance of other agents. The amount of such inner
resistance we could call <strong>resilience</strong>. Unpacking this further, <strong>political</strong> simply
means that this power affects the dynamics of <strong>social systems</strong>, which consist of
different agents interacting in an organized way, and finally, an <strong>agent</strong> is a person or
organization that we can consider to be a subject, i.e. an entity actively participating
in social systems with self-awareness and intent.</p>
<p>In physics, power is essentially the amount of energy that you can mobilize at an instant
of time to do useful work, so political power is not that different. This is of course not
surprising at all, given that the foundations of our social world are very much material.
Ultimately, most of our social world, just like the physical, is driven by evolution –
the pervasive emergent force which echoes through all life and complex life-like systems.</p>
<p>Every competitive <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system">complex adaptive
system</a> is hard-wired for
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis">autopoeiesis</a> and
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis">homeostasis</a>. To ensure survival, or more
abstractly – continuous persistence, it has to gain and keep access to various forms of
energy, i.e. resources. . So everything becomes immediately clearer if we replace the word
<em>“powerful”</em> with the word <em>“resourceful”</em>, and understanding a <em>“resource”</em> as <em>“form of
energy that you can make use of”</em>.</p>
<p>Understanding the evolutionary dynamics underlying all our social constructs also makes
one emergent “law” of power almost self-evident. Just as gravity, which clumps together
mass-energy, <strong>power tends to accumulate</strong><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-marx-1"><a href="#fn-marx">[2]</a></sup>. This, however, is not a hard Physical Law,
but a glitch (or feature) of our evolutionary programming – all life-like systems want to
not just persist, but are driven to expand in various ways, like growth and self-reproduction.</p>
<p>Just as biological evolution produced increasingly complex forms of life<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-evolution-1"><a href="#fn-evolution">[3]</a></sup>, the
social and economical evolution did the same to us – birthing nation states and
corporations, the super-organisms competing on the stage of so-called “geo-politics”. As
long as we let ourselves be governed by the automatic, “natural” but ruthless rules of
evolution, power struggles and regular crises will remain inevitable. After all, evolution
is an amoral, undirected, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm">greedy</a> <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_search_(optimization)">local
optimization</a> process. And
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_function">rules of the game</a> are perpetually
changing, so what works today can fail horribly tomorrow – this can be both a blessing
and a curse, depending on the position you are currently in.</p>
<p>All life-like systems are always at a tension between self-reinforcement, i.e. resistance
against change, and unavoidable adaptation.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-left-right-1"><a href="#fn-left-right">[4]</a></sup> Such adaptation rarely happens
voluntarily, if at all. Usually it is caused by increasing stress coming from an
evolutionary pressure – a system becomes inadequate for its environment, but remains
either unaware or unwilling to adjust parameters until the it simply collapses. Adaptation
could, in principle be gradual and incremental, but is more often than not sudden and
catastrophic – as regularly showcased by violent revolutions and coups.</p>
<h2 id="on-edge-between-cooperation-and-competition"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#on-edge-between-cooperation-and-competition" aria-label="Anchor link for: on-edge-between-cooperation-and-competition"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
On Edge Between Cooperation and Competition</h2>
<p>Why do some systems manage to be more effective than others? More precisely – why do some
societies fail and collapse, while others thrive?</p>
<p>One answer from an abstract system-theoretic point of view could be given by observing
that life tends to adapt to the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_of_chaos">edge of
chaos</a> and produce <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organized_criticality">self-organized
criticality</a>. Species can
suddenly go extinct, empires can suddenly fall and give rise to new ones – one could
consider it to be simply another statistical law of nature. If you need to be agile and
adaptive, you necessarily will most likely have some literal weak spot, some intrinsic
instability that keeps the door for change open, just wide enough.</p>
<p>Mathematically speaking, it seems to manifest in a built-in chaotic behavior that is
usually triggered when parameters of the system are pushed sufficiently far off a stable
equilibrium. Once this happens, the system undergoes an abrupt phase transition into a
different stable state, or, in the worst case, enters a volatile and chaotic phase. This
pattern can be considered to be one of the characteristics distinguishing between active,
dynamic life-like systems – and basically everything else.</p>
<p>But when looking at social systems, another source of regular failures becomes more clear
when considering a crucial difference between biological and social systems.</p>
<p><strong>In a functional complex biological system, all parts have no choice but work together
cooperatively.</strong> When they fail to do so, this is what we would consider a disease or
defect. A biological being is a single unit – all its constituent parts stand or fall
together. There is no space for uncontrolled competition, and thus a single individual is
usually not a domain for internal evolution, a biological individual is in some sense
atomic. This is as true for the organelles of eucaryotic cells as much as it true for
organs making up a body.</p>
<p><strong>Note that such biological systems also have a “power center”</strong>, only that we tend to
call it differently. If we say that the power center is whatever orchestrates and controls
the behavior, then in a single cell, the genome is hard law, and the cell core is the
executive power center controlling all internal biochemistry of the cell. Similarly, the
evolution of nervous systems, culminating in the development of a brain and the miracle of
nature that are our eyes, showing the evolutionary success of centralized aggregation and
highly specialized processing of information, combined with effective and far-reaching
control mechanisms. <strong>Stop for a moment to appreciate the beauty of that bio-chemical
miracle that our consciousness is</strong>. Our brain – the executive power center of our body
– continuously creating an integrated sense of self that is pieced together from various
unrelated senses that asynchronously collect information.</p>
<p>Now in contrast, social systems are quite different, for two main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>social systems are not atomic, they consist of agents with own interests</li>
<li>the role and relative power of individuals in a society is not fixed</li>
</ul>
<p>As humans over millennia competed over power they wanted to use to support their own
self-realization and ensure their legacy, we evolved increasingly sophisticated social
systems. But consequently, for the most time in human history, all those systems had power
centers which were designed to let the whole serve <em>them</em>, instead of them being
facilitators that effectively <em>serve the whole</em> –  like the brain is actually supposed to
do.</p>
<p>Power innately attracts a certain kind people – holding and wielding it is to them
nothing but a <em>prosthetic extension of their own self</em>. Their body, their senses, their
whole being is projected out and imprinted on the world. To them, other people are just
means to an end.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-kant-1"><a href="#fn-kant">[5]</a></sup> These people naturally end up in positions of power, because
existing power structures perpetuate themselves by promoting (both actively and passively)
like-minded people with relevant skills and traits<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-traits-1"><a href="#fn-traits">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In biological systems, an agent acting in some environment will only stop to fight and
compete if it increases the odds against other larger threats. The trade-off between
individual freedom and stability exists on various scales. Loose cooperation can lead to
higher levels of integration, until individuality is lost and some larger, more complex
organism remains.</p>
<p>We are a very social species that built huge and diverse civilizations that nobody can
maintain alone. Would then a gradual erasure and devaluation of individuals, reduction of
people to mere little gears in a clockwork, be a way forward for us? Surely, that is a
<em>possible</em> way, but certainly <em>not a desirable one</em>, even if it might turn out to be
viable<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-totalitarian-1"><a href="#fn-totalitarian">[7]</a></sup>. But there is no threat of this happening anytime soon. On the
contrary, human societies seem to follow a pattern of inter-species parasitism – growth,
welfare and self-realization of some selected few is achieved at the cost of exploitation
of many others.</p>
<p>Could there possibly be a middle ground between selfish exploitation and selfless denial
and rejection of all individuality and freedom? <strong>Can we find a path toward a mutually
beneficial balance, a fruitful voluntary symbiosis?</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-sad-tale-of-a-human-friendly-system-and-its-fall"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#the-sad-tale-of-a-human-friendly-system-and-its-fall" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-sad-tale-of-a-human-friendly-system-and-its-fall"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
The Sad Tale Of A Human-Friendly System, And Its Fall</h2>
<p>How could such a symbiotic system for humans look like? How could different, possibly
opposing interests coexist, while people still flourish and maintain a high level of
freedom and autonomy?</p>
<p>Such a system would need to check many boxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>minorities are protected from tyranny of the majority</li>
<li>the majority is protected from tyranny of a minority</li>
<li>on average, welfare is maximized and suffering is minimized</li>
<li>the system itself is protected against malicious agents</li>
<li>the system is capable to dynamically adjust the amount of individual freedom in times of
crises to ensure fast and effective mitigation</li>
</ul>
<p>Does that remind you of something? Oh right – that is what <em>democracy</em> is supposed to be –
in theory! But if it truly was like that in practice, how can we explain the fact that
most democracies are at the verge of collapse? There are many reasons for this, just
mentioning a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>the globalized, highly interdependent world grew too complex to comprehend to any single
individual, no matter how smart or qualified</li>
<li>many countries now lack a well-educated, capable and responsible political class that
is truly committed to serving the people</li>
<li>the internet opened the gates to the current flood of disinformation,
further fueled by underappreciation and under-funding of education</li>
<li>out of arrogance, democratic values lost the competition for minds and hearts, because
it was never even considered necessary to fight</li>
<li>the void left by the eroded shared values was filled by neoliberalism, its shallow
nihilistic consumerism and the lie of trickle-down-economics</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also this one big humanist idea – a morally loaded sentiment that is at the same
time important, well-intentioned, and <em>dangerously</em> naive:</p>
<p><em>If all humans have an equal right to be free, flourish and express themselves, how can
our empathy and commitment be to anything or anyone else but the welfare of <strong>every</strong>
individual or group, that is, inclusion of all humankind?</em></p>
<p>Those who defend rights and freedoms of <em>everyone</em> in an absolutist way, those who even
suggest to <em>tolerate</em> people who actively try or support <em>denying</em> others all those nice
humanistic things that we consider sacred, like basic human rights – they should do their
homework and understand the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance">paradox of
tolerance</a>. <strong>A system that does not
protect and reinforce its own foundations will necessarily crumble</strong>. Those naive
idealists are equally a big part of the problem we are facing right now as those who are
attacking our way of life.</p>
<p>Democracy is an immaterial infrastructure built in the minds of a society, and
just like other infrastructure, such as streets and bridges, it breaks down if not
maintained with <em>enough resources and genuine care</em>. Also, some people do not seem to
understand that <strong>being non-aggressive is not an excuse for being weak, and tolerating
low-key abuse is not showing strength, its stupidity.</strong></p>
<p>But before this turns even more into a rant about the self-destructive tendencies in our
failing democracies, I would rather have a look on the various forms of power the enemies
of the free society are using much more effectively.</p>
<h2 id="the-many-faces-of-power"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#the-many-faces-of-power" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-many-faces-of-power"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
The Many Faces of Power</h2>
<p>There are many ways, multiple orthogonal dimensions along which one could align and
compare facets of different forms of power, and probably doing this would be a futile
exercise. Regardless the chosen form, if you have one kind of power, you often have
various ways to convert it into other forms – so it can be difficult to draw hard lines.
But I think there are some broad distinctions that can easily be made, and there is a
certain natural progression between the different forms that power usually manifests in.</p>
<h3 id="physical-power"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#physical-power" aria-label="Anchor link for: physical-power"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Physical Power</h3>
<p>What pacifists fail to see, but the extremists of all colors understand really well is
this: when push comes to shove, <strong>the most immediate and undeniable form of power is
physical.</strong> Violence is primordial, <em>hard power</em> by force and intimidation is unescapable
and just a fact of the finite, resource-constrained, material world we live in. Animals
hunt, i.e. over-power each other. Effectively, they ignore the subject-hood of the victim,
treat the victim as a mere object, a consumable or disposable resource. While we also
developed other forms of power, our species is also exceptionally good at wielding this
timeless classic and mother of all other forms of power.</p>
<p>Unlike all the humanist ideas that developed slowly over millennia in layers upon layers
of cultural evolution, <strong>violence is truly a self-evident axiom</strong> – because <strong>diplomacy
only ever works if both sides are truly willing to, that is, both sides agree to reject
the axiom of violence and everything that logically follows from it</strong>. There is no escape
from this harsh reality and therefore the critical life lesson can only be repeated: one
can <em>not</em> afford to ever be weak, or one <em>will</em> be taken advantage of sooner or later, by
somebody living life without the burden of noble self-restraints.</p>
<h3 id="informational-power"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#informational-power" aria-label="Anchor link for: informational-power"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Informational Power</h3>
<p>Another important form of power is <em>knowledge</em> – factual information with objective
meaning. Scientific knowledge obviously belongs to this category, but also everyday
practical knowledge of various kinds is not to be underestimated. We learned how to create
fire, we learned how to create better weapons, we learned how to get more and better food,
we learned how to live together without the danger of everyday violence or disease.
<strong>Societies with more practically useful knowledge obviously are more likely to become
powerful and successful</strong>, because they can simply can control and mobilize relevant
physical resources better than the competitors.</p>
<p>Now there is not much to say about informational power, except for the fact that we
rationalist, humanist kind of people collectively overestimated the innate attraction and
gravity of objective truth, biased by our privileged and refined “high-brow” views, that
are not at all representative of how an average person thinks about their life and makes
decisions. Maybe education on rationality, critical thinking and ethics is not scalable to
whole populations, but I think that actually nobody even really tried. <strong>We always have
hundreds of billions for the military or stimulating the economy, but never for education.
No surprise that many people lost or never gained the ability to use the sharpest tool we
all have – our mind – to its full potential.</strong> One could attribute this to mere neglect,
but I claim this flaw is structural – it is the direct product out of the unholy marriage
of democracy with under-regulated capitalism.</p>
<p>We don’t need any AI-enhanced expensive tablets in schools, we just need authentic,
charismatic and smart teachers and general role models in society. <strong>The education crisis,
is in my opinion, not (only) a crisis of neglected infrastructure. It is primarily a
crisis of value and meaning.</strong> If education is reduced to the purpose of teaching a person
just the bare minimum to join the workforce in some useful function, instead of developing
young minds into well-rounded personalities with a strong moral compass and all the needed
tools to seek and find truth – then what you get is exactly what you deserve. <strong>If you do
not invest into quality of people, in the long game you are shooting into your own foot.</strong>
But this actually connects right to the next topic.</p>
<h3 id="psychological-power"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#psychological-power" aria-label="Anchor link for: psychological-power"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Psychological Power</h3>
<p>Now I am not an anthropologist to say anything about the true chronology of these
cultural developments with any authority, but I would guess that we learned to create fire
and good fruit from bad some time before we learned to lie, cheat and manipulate others.</p>
<p>Informational power is tied to reality but its anchored to the objective, material world.
In contrast, psychological power is based on belief and knowledge we have about belief and
knowledge of others. Instead of being about the physical world, everything in this realm
is deeply rooted in the human condition and the ambiguous and fluid social world of our
own making. This is why I consider psychological power to be more abstract and subtle. If
solid facts are critical for the long-term strategy, seeding and promoting narratives and
sentiments are the bread and butter of political short and mid-term tactics.</p>
<p><strong>Psychological power is transported by all the myths, stories, values, spiritual and moral
beliefs, cultural priming, and everything else that makes up the invisible fabric that our
human societies are woven from.</strong> Psychological power is what we call <em>soft power</em> – it
is being respected and valued by your partners, but also being feared by your enemies
– both outcomes are based only on your either manufactured or earned reputation. So
psychological power is all about being able to effectively encourage or discourage
behavior by other people <em>indirectly</em>.</p>
<p>This includes hidden forms of influence such as lobbyist “think-tanks” that only exist for
the purpose of direct and indirect manipulation of political decision makers, but also all
religions, ideologies and other cultural artifacts fall into this category. But aside
from the return of both politically motivated religious extremism, and religiously
motivated political extremism, <strong>currently the most concerning form of psychological power
is the power of disinformation</strong>. It only fully opened up its potential since the
beginning of the “digital age”, which started slowly in the 1970s with the development of
information technologies, and then quickly spilled with full force into our everyday life
since at least 2007 – the year when the first iPhone was released, beginning the “dumb
age of smartphones”. <strong>The rise of social media, uncontrolled peer-to-peer communication and
information flow can be considered the main catalyst, the cursed Pandora’s box that
unleashed many of the developments that we all watch unfold today.</strong></p>
<p>Whole books, many of them, are written about just this one new manifestation of
psychological power and its abuse by various players on the political stage. But the truly
novel quality of the psychological manipulation and warfare we see today is not just the
sheer scale of it, or the fact that information now can flow freely in all
directions<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-internet-1"><a href="#fn-internet">[8]</a></sup>. <strong>The recent breakthrough in psy-op technology is the recognition
that you do not even have to convince anyone to genuinely believe you, or make them align
with your goals.</strong></p>
<p>Classical rub-it-in-your-face propaganda narratives do not work so well these days in
non-religious liberal societies, at least for now. But instead of <em>in</em>doctrination with
<em>your</em> truth, it is often easier and in fact sufficient to make people stop believing
<em>anyone</em>, or even more, make people believe that they are free to believe whatever <em>they</em>
want – because <strong>if you cannot possibly know or understand the full truth, you can as
well just stay out of the big guy problems, and choose to believe whatever you want</strong>.
Methods here are multifaceted – from spreading conspiracy theories and sowing doubt and
distrust between groups of people, up to active disengagement of basic critical and
rational thinking skills in favor of a personal <em>felt truth</em>, combined with devaluation of
actual, factual, information and its supporters.</p>
<p>It is quite brilliant, actually – the chaotic noise of disinformation is engineered to
reproduce and spread the kind of sentiments and views that you need, while looking
authentic and coming <em>“from the bottom”</em>. Ultimately, this is nothing but political
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing">astroturfing</a> and digital smoke grenades that
simultaneously advance your goals, distract the enemies and keep them busy fighting among
each other.</p>
<p>The sad bottom line concerning psychological power is: once you have an environment
where emotions are trusted more than facts, psychological power can almost match the strength
of physical power in how compelling it is. There is a wise saying: <strong>“You cannot reason
somebody out of a position they did not reason themselves into in the first place.”</strong> And
if laws of reason and logic are denied, the argument by gut feeling and intuition seems to
weigh as strongly and is as compelling as a fist punching your face. You can disagree, but
you <em>cannot do anything</em> to change their mind, unless they just “feel like it”.</p>
<p>People who fell prey to the virus of the “hateful hive-mind” simply do not have the same
channels of communication a rational person. They are “informationally divergent”, their
thinking patterns are vastly different. With them we do not share the minimal common
agreement that is needed for any civil and rational discussion: the agreement that
<strong>positions and beliefs should be based on views that are logically consistent, ideally
are backed by verifiable facts, and must be either rejected or revised when
inconsistencies or provably wrong assumptions are revealed.</strong></p>
<p>If the person you talk to denies this framework, there is no point in talking to them.
Because <strong>for them, communication is a fight for dominance.</strong> Discussion is
not about finding truth or refining their position, instead it is a verbal fist-fight to
make the opponent either finally accept their view, or at least, make them shut up. Doing
neither means to them that you are “not listening” to them, and by committing the great
sin of not listening to them – they will claim – you effectively deny them their right
of free speech. Even worse, they will claim that you discriminate against their point of
view, while spreading your own “propaganda”, thus you are oppressing them and they are the
victims. It is a very different and peculiar understanding of both freedom and discussion
culture, to say the least.</p>
<p>The problem with all this is the self-preserving circular logic and built-up subconscious
psychological defenses. Once someone passed the event horizon of such a black garbage
information hole, once they lost touch with our shared consensus reality, it becomes
difficult, almost impossible to get them back. <strong>It would be much easier and cheaper to
teach people not to fall into these black holes, instead of trying to get them back.</strong> But
I fear that this ship might already have sailed by now, and it is not clear when, if at
all, we get another shot to get it right.</p>
<h3 id="economical-power"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#economical-power" aria-label="Anchor link for: economical-power"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Economical Power</h3>
<p>Now we finally come to the form of power that has come to dominate the world in the recent
times. We are talking about economical power. The origin of economical power is based in
the material world. We abstracted the value of physical goods and gave that abstracted
form a name and representation – money. But after this performative act of
self-deception, we collectively agreed to attribute value to an abstract number in a
digital system or a piece of paper. All of this of course only works as long as we keep up
the collective social fiction that these numbers carry value and that we can <em>exchange</em>
these numbers against actual material goods in the forseeable future.</p>
<p>If you understand this, you understand that economics is closer to humanities than to hard
science. Economy is not made by robots moving numbers around in an optimal, it is made by
people – who have incomplete or incorrect information and are biased by their beliefs,
hopes, fears and other flaws.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-behavioral-economics-1"><a href="#fn-behavioral-economics">[9]</a></sup> That makes modern economical <em>monetary</em> power much more
similar to psychological power than to anything else, because when the currencies
collapse, all your supposed resources vanish into thin air. To run a currency and a
healthy market, you need participants that accept and trust the rules of the
game.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-bitcoin-1"><a href="#fn-bitcoin">[10]</a></sup> Because monetary power is a socially constructed illusion, most wealthy
people diversify their assets by investing in reliable, physical things – houses, rare
metals, you name it. But ultimately, most forms of capital (except for maybe, owning a
loyal mercenary army) are only deriving their power from our acceptance of the
capitalistic framework.</p>
<h2 id="big-guns-vs-big-money-who-will-win"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#big-guns-vs-big-money-who-will-win" aria-label="Anchor link for: big-guns-vs-big-money-who-will-win"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Big Guns vs. Big Money – Who Will Win?</h2>
<p>One distinctive characteristic of our time that I noticed is the following. Power has
always been highly concentrated, but physical, economic and psychological power were
controlled by the same person or group of people – usually a king (or
equivalent), often in alliance with some church (or equivalent). The church provides the
fluff and pushes people in the desired direction, the state provides the weapons, king and
pope share the income, everybody is happy. In the modern world and especially in
democratic societies, different forms of power were mostly distributed among different
institutions. The church is separate from the state, which is separate from the economy.
That is how we all learned it in school, a pretty good idea – minimize risks of abuse by
creating a balance of powers. Only that the balance has been lost in the last 20-30 years.
The old formula never stopped working unchanged outside of The West, but right now the
most powerful ally that an aspiring king<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-king-1"><a href="#fn-king">[11]</a></sup> can get is a patron oligarch<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-oligarch-1"><a href="#fn-oligarch">[12]</a></sup>.
Only now the patron oligarchs grew so powerful that they soon will start to notice they do
not really need the kings all that much.</p>
<p>The punchline of the current situation is that the current opposition is between two
groups that have more in common than what divides them – classical autocrats that control
oligarchs and do not shy away from brute physical power, and modern oligarchs that control
autocrats, making use of their vast economical power. All of them learned how to use
suitable and complementary forms of psychological power and are eagerly applying it to
slowly create the right social substrate for their brave new world. Now this leaves one
very important question – who of the players is on <em>our</em> side, of the people? Of course,
they all say that they are, but I think we all know the depressing true answer. No matter
who wins, it is almost certain that <em>humanity</em> will lose.</p>
<h2 id="the-spiral-of-history-keeps-turning-and-twisting"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#the-spiral-of-history-keeps-turning-and-twisting" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-spiral-of-history-keeps-turning-and-twisting"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
The Spiral Of History Keeps Turning and Twisting</h2>
<p>Now this was a rather long read, and I still did not really say anything new at all. But
maybe my personal mash-up and idiosyncratic presentation of these topics somehow resonates
with you, maybe it can even enrich your own reflections on the world. Maybe you
disagree with me – then you are welcome to correct me where you believe I am wrong.</p>
<p>In any case, if you actually read all of this, thanks for sharing this moment in
space-time with me. Most articles I write in the hope of sharing something at least
interesting and maybe even new or useful. This one, I feel, is mostly for me – its
therapeutic screaming into the digital void, and it served me mainly as a narrative
vehicle for processing the crazy times we are living in. When the world is just too much,
it helps me to analyze and summarize it, break it apart, understand how it works. Even if
you cannot change the tides, it is usually good to be aware of them. We all see that
turbulences are coming our way, so fasten your seatbelts, hold on tight and stay hopeful.</p>
<p>Always remember – one part of the beauty in truth and the objective reality is that you
usually cannot keep denying it forever. Last time I checked, even the most ingenious
players of power games, all the abusers and exploiters of the common populace, despite the
absurd amount of their power and their best efforts, still cannot change neither the laws
of physics, nor the laws of logic.</p>

<p>Ultimately this is nothing but the vision of any totalitarian ideology
(regardless whether “extreme left” or “extreme right”), when thought until the very
end – a whole nation, acting as one single body and a single mind, sacrificing itself
fully for some great purpose. Totalitarian visions seem to always off some grand
drama and pathos. One <em>can</em> imagine people being “happy”, for some definition of
happy, if only because of the lack of imagination or desire for any other form of
existence. Nevertheless, to a free-spirited human being, this form of existence can
only be considered a repulsive threat, and the culture and social feelings of

sympathize with the idea and can see where it is coming from, but came to the
conclusion that trying to eliminate trust is impossible and the removal of
trust-carrying institutions creates more problems than it solves. Maybe, just maybe,

but we do not have such problems in The West, only some minor issues with lobbyism and
transparency. And the military groups we dislike are uncivilized terrorists, but the
ones we support with money and weapons are poor liberation activists and have no other
choice. Sometimes it is exhausting trying to keep track of all these distinct names
