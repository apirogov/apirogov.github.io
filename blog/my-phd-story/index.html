Abstract</h1>
<p><em>In this essay I will describe how life was like for me in the heights of the ivory tower,
how I got there, how it is like to do theory, share some insights I gained and explain why
I personally decided to leave academia (or at least the researcher role) behind, even
though I initially thought that I would stay. To clear up any confusion - science is not
perfect and has its share of problems, but this is not another story uncovering its warts
and flaws. On the contrary, this is a friendly “it’s is not you, it’s me” break-up letter
from my three year long relationship with academic research.</em></p>
<p><em>Everyone has their own unique personal story and sometimes you want to hear subjective
impressions and experiences, but I do not see too many written down. I would have been
interested in reading such reports from people with similar background before I started,
so I provide one myself now and hope this helps someone to decide whether he or she wants
to embark on this trip. This is a story of finding your way through the possibilities
before you, expectations clashing with reality, and honest self-reflection.</em></p>
<p><em>I won’t talk about the actual topics I was working on, but rather focus on my personal
path, feelings and insights about the whole process, how it all evolved and what I
learned. This is a rather long essay, but I think it is appropriate as a summary of a
three-year long journey.</em></p>

From hobby coder to theoretician</h2>
<p>I knew that I was going to be a “software developer” for a long time, as I picked up
programming as a hobby early in my childhood. So it was clear to me that I am
going to study computer science after graduating from high school. I was always
quite good in math, but I would not call myself “brilliant” in math and
initially it has never been my main interest. Originally, <strong>I went to university
for the “deeper” computer science topics</strong>, motivated to learn the theory behind
compiler construction, machine learning and other quite applied topics that I
could relate to in some way.</p>
<p>Like everyone else I’ve had my problems in the first math courses when the
homework was to prove some very simple properties. How detailed a proof is
supposed to be? How does one even go about it? But after getting the hang of it,
it was even kind of fun. The main insight at that point was that <strong>a proof has
atomic structures that build up to more complex ones, just like a program</strong> is
build up from the atomic control flow supported by the language. But instead of
if-then-else, for- and while-loops you have general proof techniques like
induction, proof by contradiction, case splitting, and some more topic-specific
mechanisms and patterns that you can learn and use (it was still before I
learned about the
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence">Curry-Howard-Isomorphism</a>
and proof assistants, which use this similarity in a quite literal way).</p>
<p>Then came the courses in theoretical computer science. This is the moment where
I thought, “Yes, now <em>that’s</em> the stuff I came here for!”. At this time I
noticed that I quite enjoy learning about theory, especially concerning logic
and discrete maths, and started falling in love with it. Still, I felt more like
a slightly more illuminated programmer than anything else. I was often the guy
explaining complicated topics to others, so I often was told ridiculous things
like <em>“you would be a great professor”</em>, which was giving me the first thoughts
about staying in university for more than just the master’s degree.</p>
<p>Quite by chance it came to be that I wrote my bachelor’s thesis about a purely
theoretical topic. This is where I learned the first time how this “proof”
business really works. It clicked for me that in the larger picture, results you
use which others proved is like using a library. Lemmas are like helper functions for
easier reading and modularity, etc., but unlike programming languages,
<strong>mathematical notation has no limits, you define your own syntax, hopefully with
a good sense for conventions</strong>. It was also my first exposure to scientific
papers.</p>
<p>During my master’s I seriously began to ponder about doing a PhD in some
interesting field close to or in theory. Even though I had good grades, I
had doubts: “<strong>Am I really smart enough for this?</strong>” I always regarded myself as a
quite good programmer who is able to understand and apply even complicated
theory that I learn, but I think no one gives out PhDs just for that. Will I be
able to come up with enough smart ideas myself?</p>
<p>Reading a lot on the internet about burnt-out doctoral students did not really
help, but quickly I understood that the <strong>conditions of PhD students are wildly
different</strong> and reports of students in e.g. the US really say nothing about the
situation in Germany. Also, I was encouraged by the advisor of my bachelor’s and
master’s thesis (an almost finished PhD student himself) to go for it, as he
judged me as more than capable enough for this. After hearing about his
experiences and getting some valuable advice I decided that I have to at least
try. Because in a few years I would rather tell the story that I tried and
failed rather than that I probably could, but didn’t try. And after leaving
academia, most people never come back.</p>
<p>Additionally, in my idealistic view, doing research and trying to
understand things not out of necessity, but rather out of curiosity and just for
its own sake, is at the same time one of the most absurd and most human
activities one can partake in. <strong>I just could not live with the thought of
missing out on something like that.</strong> So in my final master’s semester I started
to look for positions and send out applications.</p>
<h2 id="phd-funding-in-every-flavour"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#phd-funding-in-every-flavour" aria-label="Anchor link for: phd-funding-in-every-flavour"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
PhD funding in every flavour</h2>
<p>For doing a PhD in Germany you have multiple options. I will shortly sketch the main
possibilities, as I understand them. In principle, you can write a dissertation while
working at a company, but this seems to be rather rare, at least in computer science, and
I can not say anything about this.</p>
<p>For the possibilities where you are actually staying in university, multiple sources of
funding exist. The worst option is being a doctoral stipendiate. As I
understand, you will work as much as all the others do, but get a laughable
stipend (compared to what you usually earn with a master’s in CS) and no social
security benefits etc., because you still count as a student and not as employee
of the university. This was an option I did not even really consider, following
one advice that I got - <strong>know what you are worth</strong>.</p>
<p>In the remaining options <strong>you are usually employed by the university for
three years</strong>, with different possible sources of funding (after three years, you
will have to get some other funding). Either your position is state-funded,
funded from a research grant, sponsored by some industry partner or you get a
position in either a graduate school or research training group (RTG), where the
latter two differ in that a graduate school is a permanent or long-running
institution, whereas an RTG is a one-time funding for a number of positions. In
many scientific disciplines, you usually will only get a 1/2 or 2/3 position if
you are lucky, while <strong>in computer science full positions are the default</strong>, as
there are several other attractive employment opportunities for computer
scientists outside of academia.</p>
<p>The contract of a state-funded position assigns a certain percentage of your
time officially for organizing and assisting the teaching done at that chair,
but it is also the most unrestricted option concerning the topics you can
investigate. On the other end of the spectrum, industry-funded positions are
often bound to some narrow specific area of interest which the company hopes to
eventually turn into a product (and might offer you a job afterwards, if your
are successful), but I think this option does not really exist in purely
theoretical disciplines.</p>
<p>Funding from a research grant is also given expecting results in some specific
topic it was granted for, but this is possible for any kind of discipline.
An RTG or graduate school is also focused on some (rather broad) field, but
additionally is a structured program, which means that you are expected to
attend some courses and to finish your dissertation ideally within the three
years of funding, but you are (officially) freed from teaching obligations.
Details may vary depending on your field and institution. In Germany, research
grants, RTGs and graduate schools are usually funded by the German Research
Society (DFG), which is effectively also funded by the state, but in a more
indirect way, because the DFG, which is essentially the self-organization of the
research in Germany, decides about funding autonomously.</p>
<p>In practice, the differences in funding probably will not influence your
day-to-day experience very much and each chair has people with various funding
sources. Usually, tasks related to teaching are split up so that every PhD
student will participate in some way. Also, <strong>for almost every funding
possibility, the project outline is formulated sufficiently broad to keep enough
freedom of choice for you to find a good dissertation topic</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="finding-a-good-position-a-constraint-satisfaction-problem"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#finding-a-good-position-a-constraint-satisfaction-problem" aria-label="Anchor link for: finding-a-good-position-a-constraint-satisfaction-problem"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Finding a good position - a constraint satisfaction problem</h2>
<p>It should probably be said that my path to a PhD position was rather exotic (so I was
told), as the usual path goes like this – you write your master’s thesis, at some point you
are either asked by or you ask one of your professors whether you would like to
stay for a PhD, then the professor finds a way (one of those sketched above) to
fund you and then you often will just continue with your topic, branching out in
all possible directions, until you have produced enough novel research for a
dissertation.</p>
<p>While that might be the usual modus operandi, I am not sure that it always leads
to the best results. I don’t like surprises, I prefer to choose consciously
what exactly I am getting into and choose the most appropriate option for me.
Also, I was not fully invested into some narrow and specific topic, hence I was
flexible in this regard. So I spent quite some time understanding the advantages
and disadvantages of the myriad of possibilities and then started looking,
trying to optimize for multiple variables.</p>
<p>My main constraints were: staying in northern Germany, if possible without
needing to move, of course a full position, in a good research group, with a
topic I am or can become genuinely interested in and a benevolent advisor I can
talk to regularily if I want or need to. <strong>You often can not control or even know
all of those variables, because of course there is luck involved</strong> in whether
there are appropriate positions available. In the end I dropped the
no-relocation constraint and extended my acceptable radius, as there were not
that many interesting positions that checked enough of the boxes for me. I
applied for one state-funded position and two RTGs. I got a rejection for the
state-funded position, as my master’s was not finished soon enough for them, but
I got accepted by both RTGs, from which I chose the one that looked more
attractive to me.</p>
<p><strong>The applications you send out usually describe your academic path, interests and
your motivation to join the specific group. This often must be supported by a
letter of recommendation</strong> by one or two professors and, of course, by good
grades. In the case of RTGs, if you pass the first round, you get invited to an
interview. Before the actual interview you probably will have a 20 minute talk
about your previous research, e.g. what you did in your master’s thesis. Some
days after this you get notified whether you are accepted or not.</p>
<p>I have often read the advice that the main aspect in the decision of
where to apply is that <strong>your future advisor should be both an experienced,
active researcher and also actually a good advisor</strong>. That if the advisor is not
doing his job well, you could be in for a bad time, as this person is the
biggest single factor determining your success, which I believe is true.
But this information is hard to come by and you either obtain it directly in private
by talking to people at your university (if you want to stay there), or
indirectly by checking the publications of the advisors and how many people
actually left that chair and advisor with a completed PhD. I had the privilege
of getting some useful direct hints and I am glad that everything turned out
really well for me.</p>

How did I get here?!</h2>
<p>So there I was, a fresh member of the RTG, in a nice two-person office with a
gigantic whiteboard, two screens and a couch, friendly coworkers and an endless
supply of coffee, and was essentially paid for reading a lot and then hopefully
coming up with some good ideas of my own.</p>
<p>My first thought was: <em>This is the best job ever, I am living the dream!</em>
My second thought was: <em>It is surreal—now I am getting paid for finding solutions to
problems and producing ideas concerning concepts that literally 99,999% of people cannot
even not care about, as they don’t even know about them</em>.
Even more – I almost felt guilty
for having a bigger salary than all those people working in underpaid, but
genuinely important jobs. And for what? For solving riddles that I find more or
less interesting (just to be clear – not that I would pay scientists less, but
people in underpaid but socially valuable jobs more, but wage economics is not
the topic here).</p>
<p>The combination of those two thoughts was leading to the following resolution
dictated by my guilt of privilege – I better be good at the riddle-solving. On
one hand, the organizers of the RTG expect this from me. If I fail, I risk the
funding for the next RTG (as certain promises were made to the funding agency).
On the other hand, I owe it to all the people who are not as lucky as I am.
So I decided—what I lack in smarts I am going to compensate with sheer
motivation, work ethics and preseverance, and in the end I am going to rock my
dissertation! Sometimes being able to pressure yourself into action can be quite useful.</p>
<h2 id="learning-to-swim-and-finding-a-rhythm"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#learning-to-swim-and-finding-a-rhythm" aria-label="Anchor link for: learning-to-swim-and-finding-a-rhythm"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Learning to swim and finding a rhythm</h2>
<p>The first two weeks, besides trying to find my way through the building, learning the
names of coworkers and finding out how things work, I was mainly trying to digest
about 2-3 sets of lecture notes about topics that I needed to (or should) know
working there, but had just a rudimentary background in. It felt like a
learning marathon before an exam, with the difference that I was actually seeing
the content for the first time, but trying to learn it as if I already have seen it
before.</p>
<p>As this obviously cannot work, I eventually decided to give up on rigor and go
for a good-enough approach – <strong>just getting a rough picture of all important
results and relationships and not wasting time understanding all proofs in
detail</strong>. The other option would be to spend a few months going though all of
this rigorously, but with the pressure I created for myself this did not feel
acceptable. Of course, this phase would not have been such a jump into cold
water if I would have stayed at my original university like a sane person (which
I could, but it was an inferior option), and therefore would already have the
perfect background. But this little start disadvantage was no big deal anyway, as
<strong>learning new things all the time is part of the job</strong>.</p>
<p>I never had real problems with procrastination or organizing myself and in the first
year I was one of the first people at the office in the morning and one of the
last ones leaving in the afternoon. Anything less, and I would feel that I am
lazy and do not work enough. As time went on and motivation waned a bit, I got
more and more sloppy with this, because 9-to-5 is against my biology. But at the
beginning, my willpower was strong, I wanted to get results as quickly as
possible and the only thing you can do is never stop looking. That’s why it’s
called research, obviously. <strong>In the best case, your advisor sends you into a
good direction by throwing you a bone in form of a rough idea. In the worst
case, you are on your own.</strong> In any case there is much work to do to sculpt that
starter bone into something worth writing down and publishing, so this is swimming –
alone, in deep, open waters.</p>
<p>After the first serious talk to my advisor, I tried to parse the papers he
handed me, each corresponding to one of about three rough directions I could go
in my research. I should make up my mind about what I’d rather do. After reading
one paper and a bit of thinking, I decided against one of the topics, where (a
recurring motif!) I was not sure what I would be getting into, and I am not that
brave to jump right into unfamiliar territory. The other two topics were not
mutually exclusive and more close to topics that I had background in, and I
chose the more familiar one. I am glad that I had these possibilities laid out
before me, because I’ve heard that <strong>many PhD students spend the first year just
finding out what they are going to do</strong> as their main project (luckily for them,
they are usually not expected to graduate in three years, but any funding will
end eventually).</p>
<p>I think that joining an RTG, where your research already has
some rough outlined direction, was the perfect fit for me. I feel that I would not
have been able to deal with the uncertainty of complete freedom. Learning to
swim is hard enough, it’s nice to have a beacon.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-primary-school-reading-and-writing"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#back-to-primary-school-reading-and-writing" aria-label="Anchor link for: back-to-primary-school-reading-and-writing"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Back to primary school – reading and writing</h2>
<p>Part of learning to swim and not drown in academia is to <strong>learn to judge what
is worth your time</strong>. There will be piles of papers, old and new, that are in
some way related or close to your field of research. Which one should you read
in detail? Which ones should just be skimmed for the main results? Do you need
to understand this section? When half your day you are reading papers (like you
probably will, in the beginning), you better do it efficiently.</p>
<p>When learning as a student, I usually did not skip anything. I only felt
prepared for an exam if I understood and was ready for every topic that was in
the course. At least, as ready as I could be. Well, in the “real world”, there
are (obviously) no packed-up, prechewed bites of information that you can try to
digest fully. There is this <strong>vast sea of knowledge that you have to learn to
navigate through</strong>. And you have to decide how long to stay at which place and
keep the destination in mind.</p>
<p><strong>The knowledge in papers is usually densely compressed</strong>. There are papers
where you stare at one page for hours and just don’t get what the author is
doing and why (and if you are unlucky, there are mistakes in the paper slowing
you down and it is badly written). It takes time to figure out how much hard
staring at the same paragraph or sentence is appropriate before giving up and
just pushing on, in the hope that you can understand enough without fully
understanding a definition or result (sometimes you can, but often not), or
whether it is better to return to the paper later, after reading up on other
things it is building on, or at least with a refreshed mind. So sometimes, it’s
like working your way through a brick wall, with bare hands.</p>
<p>Generally, I tend to skim text a lot. I think that I am good at getting a
intuitive, vague idea of almost anything quickly and, usually, skimming a text
is sufficient for this. The downside is, that for me sometimes <strong>it is hard to
slow down for extended periods of time to read attentively word by word. Which
you must do, if you are trying to understand a math-heavy paper deeply.</strong> Any
sentence you skip might contain a definition or equation that is crucial a few
lines (in the best case) or many pages later. So if I catch myself at skimming a
section that I was actually trying to understand, it just means that I’m
exhausted and need a break and/or a coffee. I guess, all these woes is what
helps building up the mythical skill called “<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_maturity">mathematical
maturity</a>”, which is
allegedly required to understand some topics.</p>
<p>When reading through the zoo of symbols, <strong>it is often helpful to create
concrete and visual examples for yourself wherever they are missing in the
paper</strong>. If the paper has some nice examples already included, consider yourself
lucky. In my opinion, examples and visual representation are crucial for
understanding. You can read as many definitions as you want, but it is hard to
understand the full consequences and getting an intuition without seeing some
instances and non-instances. <strong>The reading definitely will become easier over
time, after being exposed to different notations and knowing the “writing
tropes” of your field.</strong> Eventually you will just read the beginning, the end, the
main results, and then only switch to attentive linear reading when there is a
need for it. Reading papers on unfamiliar topics will probably always remain
more difficult, though.</p>
<p>After much reading, in the end you also have to do some writing. Which consists
of well-formulated theorems with sufficiently (but again, not over-the-top)
rigorous proofs. And when you have enough of those, they must be crammed into
some paper, at some point. Usually students have gained experience from writing
their two theses, but writing papers is a different story. <strong>Eventually, you
have to master the quite specific skill of writing papers with a limit of 12-15
pages from a draft of 30+ pages</strong> without losing too much substance. To publish
the results from my master’s thesis at a conference, I had compressed my
master’s thesis down from over 70 to about 25 pages, which my thesis advisor
then miraculously shrinked down further to 15, including references. As I was
just starting out at that time, this seemed like an impressive achievement, but
later I learned how to do this myself.</p>
<p>If coming up with good ideas is the art of science, then <strong>reading, writing and
presenting are the craft of science and hopefully your advisor helps you to
become a good craftsman</strong>. Well, coming up with good ideas that are worth looking
into is also a craft, but this craft is only practiced by the
experienced researchers and is much more difficult to master.</p>
<h2 id="getting-used-to-being-on-the-other-side"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#getting-used-to-being-on-the-other-side" aria-label="Anchor link for: getting-used-to-being-on-the-other-side"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Getting used to being on the other side</h2>
<p>At first, it was a weird feeling to sit with a coffee in my hand in a seminar
talk that is held by a student. <strong>As a student, it always felt as if those PhD
guys already know everything</strong> I am going to present better than I do. I quickly
learned that this impression of mine was quite wrong. <strong>Suddenly, I understood
that the people sitting there are just normal people too</strong>. After a
particularily bad talk, I asked my coworker ironically, whether she understood
as much of the proofs as I did. She just said: <em>“I think that almost nobody
understood any of it, it was horrible”</em>. It might be mundane, but at the same
time this reply was enlightening and liberating.</p>
<p>I am not a self-confident person and tend to always feel as if the people I work with
are much better than me. In a healthy dose, this is a good thing and motivates me to
work harder. A scientist needs some humility and there is a saying that goes
like – if you are the smartest person in a room, you are in the wrong room. In
an unhealthy dose, this just ignites
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a> – feeling
that I was just lucky and actually didn’t belong there. So sometimes, it is nice
be reminded that the others are and probably feel not that different.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-year-new-experiences-and-first-victories"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#the-first-year-new-experiences-and-first-victories" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-first-year-new-experiences-and-first-victories"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
The first year - new experiences and first victories</h2>
<p>The first half of my three years doing my PhD was exciting and feeling like
being on a winning streak. From the beginning I had some ideas what to work on
from my advisor and had my first not too hard but still neat results right after
2-3 months, which was enough material for a first paper. While it seemed that
this would be slightly off-topic from what my main focus was supposed to be, it
turned out to be important later on.</p>
<p>In the beginning <strong>everything was fresh and new</strong>, I was attending two
summer schools (one in Warsaw and one in Paris) on topics close to my research
area, a conference (in Tokyo!) to present the results of my first paper and one
workshop in Berlin. Just starting out and full of motivation, almost every topic
is new and interesting, as there is very much going on in research that is not
taught in a regular university course, which can lag a few years or
decades behind the current frontier of knowledge, depending on the topic and
whether the dust has already settled. <strong>Travelling internationally to learn new
things, present your research and meet other PhD students and also some big
names of your field is without doubt an exciting and fun experience.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But the day-to-day “routine” consists of reading a lot, thinking more, and
scribbling much nonsense, hopefully with something useful in between, on the
whiteboard</strong>. A few times a week there were some compulsory and some optional
lectures and talks. I held a few presentations of my own and I took part in a
reading group about various topics (because we could not decide on one field
we’re all interested in equally, we decided to dip our toes in many things, one
after the other). But other than that, the day consisted of (often fruitless)
thinking, reading, writing and coding. Even though I still often felt like the
dumbest guy on our floor, I just tried not to think too much about it. I told
myself that I was academically brought up at at different university and
probably know other things than my colleagues, most of whom spent all their
academic life there.</p>
<p>I did appreciate my privilege of not having to do almost any teaching
assistance, because as I have learned, not everybody from our RTG was really
freed from these tasks (even if we all were, according to the contract).
I do enjoy teaching and had many student jobs doing it, but basically organizing
the whole lecture, coming up with exercises and exams and handling all the
bureaucracy connected with it is a whole different story. I can’t really imagine
completing my thesis in 3-3.5 years if I would have had to invest a third or
half of my time in such activities. Luckily for me, I was mainly just advising
half a dozen students who were writing their bachelor’s or master’s theses on
topics somewhat related to my research area. Over a span of three years this is
really not that much of a burden, especially when having the pleasure of dealing
with somewhat capable students.</p>
<p>About a year in, I was still very motivated, but maybe a little bit less “hyped”
– I didn’t start working before 9am as I did for a while before, and I had a lot
less sleepless nights, as I somehow <strong>finally managed to learn to take breaks
from thinking about work</strong> (another important skill to learn).
This was much easier to do when doing implementation work and wearing my
“software developer hat”, as writing code is not the kind of thing I can’t stop
thinking about and keeping me awake like some unsolved theoretical riddle.</p>
<p><strong>I liked the fact that I had both theoretical and also implementation work
to do, because, ocassionally, I hated one or the other, depending on
where I was currently stuck.</strong> Some days I thought that I’d like to go full
theoretician, live in the perfect platonic world of mathematical abstraction and
never write code again, as code is always messy, unforgiving and full of bugs.
On other days I thought that I am not made of the material and lack the talent
to do serious theory and just should accept that eventually I will have to join
the ranks of software developers (which ultimately is what happened).</p>

The paper-writing business - writing for human beings</h2>
<p>I learned much in the process of writing my first paper. My original approach
was completely backwards – I always had the 12 page restriction of the
conference in the back of my mind. So I tried to compress as much information as
possible into those 12 pages. My thinking was more ore less: <em>“Papers are dense
and hard to read, this is normal. So I just shrink all the technical details and
fit them into the required format. If understand this stuff, then those much
smarter guys will understand it too”</em>. But I underestimated how those smarter
guys are not working on the stuff I do and hence are not so intimately familiar
with it, because they did not lose nights of sleep over it. Fortunately, I had a
patient advisor who pointed out all the problems with my first draft. I quickly
learned that <strong>many papers are only hard to read because they are written badly</strong>.</p>
<p>The main problem was that the storytelling in my draft was really lacking and I
had the wrong idea of what belongs into the 12 pages of a conference paper. My
first draft was too technical and more or less unreadable, the final version has
a much longer introduction and it was <strong>only as formal as necessary to precisely
state the results and briefly sketch the proofs</strong>. Previously I didn’t know that
my proofs do not necessarily need to go into the proceedings (the book
collecting the papers presented at a conference) and may be provided in the
appendix only for the reviewers to judge the correctness of the results. I
mentioned how proofs are similar to programs in the beginning, and my mistake
was taking this metaphor too literally and forgetting that proofs in papers are
read by human beings. Writing for humans means that <strong>sometimes you can leave
out tedious but easy details, but you have to explain the difficult part
especially well</strong>.</p>
<p>It turns out that you can’t have interesting content, be understandable and also
provide full proofs on 12 pages and <strong>the good style is to prefer “nice to read”
over “complete”</strong>, because the purpose of a conference paper is to
communicate your results and main ideas on how to get them as clearly as
possible. Of course, the complete version with all the details is to be provided
in an extended journal version (which is rarely done) or by some <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/">other
means</a>.</p>
<p>Thinking about it now, I would say that <strong>the secret to good writing is
<em>emphatic</em> writing</strong>. You need to write for someone like you, but before you
learned what you know now. You should anticipate the questions the reader can
have and preemptively discuss and answer them. You must illustrate complex
ideas and constructions with enough clarifying examples, remind the reader of
earlier sections that could be already forgotten and guide him through your
document like a good teacher is teaching a student.</p>
<p>So <strong>the best approach to writing a readable paper is writing as if it was a
thesis</strong> – elaborating all proofs in detail, writing a lot of prose, giving enough
intuitive explanations, adding many examples and only <em>then</em> shrinking it down
by removing as many details as necessary to fit into the constraints set up by
the conference. The two weeks I was working on my first paper were quite
stressful and I was really happy that the resulting version did convince the
reviewers.</p>

Hubris and pipe dreams - learning rigorous thinking</h2>
<p>At some point in my first year, my advisor gave me an interesting connection to
look into which later became the main topic of my dissertation – two
superficially quite different solutions to the same problem that can suddenly
look quite similar, when you look hard enough and in a certain way. It was a
connection that no one spotted yet and that only someone deeply experienced in
the field (like my advisor) would notice. But when you did see it, it was
screaming at you. So he said that it would be nice if I would formalize and
flesh out the connection, and of course even better if I could find a more
general formulation where the two known approaches to the problem come out as
special cases, giving me some ideas about what might work. Such a tasty treat!
Instantly I was hooked, and quickly started running with full force from one
wall into the other.</p>
<p>Of course, I thought, just fleshing out the connection is boring, I ambitiously
hoped to find a way to carve out the grand unifying idea behind the two
approaches, in its most general and purest form. The one ultimate construction
for this problem that all other approaches can be reduced to, and no less! So
right after superficially understanding both constructions and just enough of
the proofs, I jumped into my usual mode of thought – question everything.</p>
<p>Maybe the previous researchers had a solution that is too complicated, maybe I
can see it more clearly than they did, if I think long enough? At first I
thought, it would be nice to develop this most general solution to the problem
cleanly from scratch, equipped with the knowledge about the two approaches. I
started with my understanding of what needs to be taken care of and tried to
formulate it with as few assumptions and mechanisms as possible – all just to
arrive right back at an even more contrieved description of one of the
approaches, with other nomenclature for various elements and without any idea
how to prove my description correct. After reinventing a weird version of the
existing approaches myself, I was stuck and had to go back to the start.</p>
<p>Ok then, if I can not work from zero to the awsome most general version, then I
will just work my way back. So I tried to deconstruct every aspect of the
constructions that looked incidental and not essential to me. One day, I thought
that a complicated aspect can be more or less left out and the process still
works. Excited, I talked to my advisor, only for him to quickly point out the
case where my simplified idea did not work. If I looked more thoroughly, I
should have noticed it myself.</p>
<p>There was a second similar moment where I thought that I found a simpler
solution. I did not want to annoy my advisor with obviously wrong ideas again, I
thought. So I tried to prove my idea first. I was very close to succeeding, or
so I believed. But one, just one case was missing in the proof. It was a crucial
case. While trying to argue that my approach works I was forced to think it
through so thoroughly that I noticed where it goes wrong. My feelings about it
were a mix of disappointment about yet another failure and pride that this time
I noticed it myself and did not embaress myself in front of my advisor.</p>
<p>So a few weeks of thinking about this problem were like a carousel of thinking
that I am close to or even have discovered some beautiful, simple truth
underneath it all, and then the obligatory painful fall back to earth. It’s all
too easy to give in to wild speculations and quite hard to critically assess
your ideas, especially when the problems usually hide in aspects you are not
aware of.</p>
<p><strong>My greatest mistake at this point was that I started to over-abstract the
problem and define stuff without having a <em>proper</em> understanding of what is
going on</strong>, without being sure that I really see the whole picture. I wanted too
much, too quickly. Building the <em>right intuitions</em> is crucial. Each time I
thought that I really got it, a quick conversation with my advisor opened up other
flaws in my thinking. Each time I thought that I gained some deep insight, it
was just what my advisor meant all along and I just finally reached him there,
already standing and waiting for me on the top of what looks to me like a
mountain, but really is just a small hill on the way. With my over-ambitious
attitude, <strong>it was in hindsight inevitable that in the beginning I was just
reinventing the wheel</strong>, but while it was not yet leading to a result, at least
this way I eventually soaked up all nuances of the problem.</p>
<h2 id="using-math-to-understand-abstract-concepts"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#using-math-to-understand-abstract-concepts" aria-label="Anchor link for: using-math-to-understand-abstract-concepts"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Using math to understand abstract concepts</h2>
<p>Of course it was a naive way of approaching things. Mathematically, it was not
clear what the “essence” I was looking for even was and <strong>I wasted some time
chasing mirages. On this path there only lies madness and pseudoscience.</strong> On
one hand, you need to shape your mathematical intuition to “feel” the things you
are working with as a theoretician. On the other hand, <strong>it is a big mistake to
mix up the ineffable intuition in your head with actual math</strong> and I was trying
to hunt for something ignoring the most powerful tool, which is language, or in
this case, mathematical formalism. In the end, <strong>we can only truly understand
and explain that which we can write down and by constraining our thoughts it
also gives them shape and concreteness</strong>. I just should have stayed closer to
and not disregarded decades of previous work.</p>
<p>My advisor of course approached the problem from a more pragmatic and effective
point of view, like <em>“What properties do we need so that we can complete a
slightly more general variant of the proof?”</em> whereas I was asking <em>“What is the
essence of this thing? If I think that I have it, I will try to prove it using
this insight.”</em> And probably this is where I had it backward. I underestimated
the <strong>importance of proofs in the understanding of a problem</strong>. Some concepts
are so utterly abstract that you maybe can not understand them in any other way
than by the things you were able to prove about them. And even if you manage to
dream up something that is right, it does not matter unless you can prove it, so
<strong>intuitive explorations should not be done for excessive amounts of time without
trying to crystallize it down into a theorem to prove or disprove it</strong>. Many ideas
can be quickly thrown into the garbage by some simple counterexample.</p>
<p>I waited for an inner mental image to eventually emerge such that you can point
at it and say “this is that thing”, but probably the human mind is not capable
to provide this “visuality” and “intuitiveness” for more complicated matters, at
least not mine. <strong>You have proofs as little windows of clarity in the vast
complexity of some problem</strong> or field and the kind of intuition that one gains
with experience is not (always) visual and clear, but rather ineffable and
wobbly. You can’t just think about your problem intuitively, waiting for clarity
to appear out of thin air, no, <strong>you have to try to prove or disprove things,
and by doing this you gain some more understanding</strong>. Maybe this is obvious to
everyone working in theory, but for me this was a new and important insight.</p>
<p>So essentially, <strong>doing theory is balancing playful and intuitive thinking that
you need to get a creative spark, and the disciplined and attentive work of
sculpting and materializing this spark into a watertight proof.</strong> As every mind
works differently, probably there is no one-size-fits-all way of finding a good
(that is, productive) process, so I guess this is one of the many things that
can only be learned by doing. Hitting walls many, many times until eventually
breaking through is not avoidable, so <strong>accepting failure is also part of the
process</strong>.</p>
<p>Each failed attempt and wrong idea improves understanding and is a piece of the
puzzle. This whole phase of gaining intuition for a problem feels like
spiralling around some wobbly idea for some time, but never quite landing on it,
and trying to grab something slippery, until in the end you hopefully do. There
is no shame in starting off existing proofs, because these are the few things
that you can really hold on to. <strong>Not every result has to be groundbreakingly
innovative and probably most research is an incremental improvement obtained by
modification or combination of existing ideas</strong>, not unlike evolution works.</p>
<p>Concerning the problem I was working on—in the end I did succeed, but the
result was more conservative than what I originally aspired to and in fact quite
close to what my advisor had in mind. So another obvious lesson I had to learn
the hard way would be – <strong>if you do happen to have a good advisor, better trust
his approach, because he will know from decades of experience what might work</strong>.
Even though it is worthwhile and fun to wander around in the wild mindspace
sometimes, it is really easy to get lost in the forest of ideas when you run off
the path shown by your guide.</p>

Part-time developer - doing it wrong and then a bit better</h2>
<p>As far as I know, I was one of the most “practical” guys in our CS theory
department, by working on a complex piece of C++ software as a part of my
PhD project. I silently listened to that ocassional <em>“Everyone assumes I am good
at programming just because I studied CS, but programming sucks, right guys?!”</em>
theoretician snark and thought to myself that it’s not <em>that</em> bad. Of course I
don’t mean boring enterprise software that just glues stuff together. But I do
think that programming is quite a lot of fun, when you solve interesting
problems, and programming in academia usually involves just the right kind of
problems.</p>
<p>It is known that <strong>most software produced in academia are “eternal prototypes”</strong>,
as in the end you are more or less paid to write papers and not for producing
highly reliable software for production. The tool I was working on was
in my opinion quite a complex beast with many moving parts (various
optimizations to be freely combined with each other) and in parallel I was still
trying to find the right subset of C++ to use for my personal productivity
sweet-spot. This is why after a few months <strong>I decided to do a half-rewrite of
what I’ve done</strong>. As a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskeller</a> at heart, I was
working at a too high abstraction level than is usable by inexperienced C++
programmers, as I am, in a productive way. I basically tried to write Haskell in
C++, using every feature of modern C++ that helped me doing it. I tried to write
code as general as possible. In Haskell this is easy, where you eat polymorphic
functions for breakfast. But in C++ you quickly get entangled in the darkest of
template sorcery.</p>
<p>Yes, you can easily write simple functional code in C++ for some years now. But
I’ve experienced myself that the things that Haskell gives you are so much
more than that and even if technically possible, I am not crazy
enough to try replicating and using these things in C++. While error
messages by GHC (the Haskell compiler) are verbose, they are often very useful
and pinpoint the problem, often even hinting at a solution. When you mess up
at more involved template magic, you get 10 pages of irrelevant error messages
that sometimes provide no digestable information at all. Never mind the fact that
template code that is not instantiated is not even checked. Debugging templates
is basically a nightmare. So my new approach became – <strong>as general as
necessary, instead of as general as possible</strong>. And I learned the valuable
lesson that <strong>one should not write language X like language Y</strong>, in the end
there is more than just syntax and if you do not follow the spirit and idioms of
the language, you just make your work harder.</p>
<p>I would say that my first implementation attempt was still not completely
worthless—it was necessary to understand where I need some flexibility and
where I do not and how the pieces should fit together. In the end though, I
reimplemented my algorithms a last time in modern Java, using a nice framework
where they could be neatly integrated to, because <strong>I hoped that the framework
will live longer than my C++ prototype that already was starting to decay</strong> (the
first Github issue was opened after a year by someone complaining about
compilation problems that appeared because a library I was using changed its
API). This final reimplementation was a much nicer experience than fighting with
C++, in fact so nice that I have not much to say about it. Maybe it was the
combination of a saner language with actually knowing what I am doing when
implementing it the third time. At least now I know that for many reasons I
would very much prefer a Java job over a C++ job (if it has to be one of those
two), so this helped guiding my job search preferences later on.</p>

Slowly getting rid of the training wheels</h2>
<p>I have written two papers with my advisor about the correspondence that I
mentioned and some extensions and improvements that I implemented in
my prototype tool which is based our neat theoretical result. Then, after having
learned all those valuable lessons about “the process” of doing theory, <strong>in my
second year I was working mostly alone and in a more open-ended direction</strong> and
I was starting to see my advisor much less often.</p>
<p>This time, my advisor did not give me any concrete ideas to work out and just
told me to look myself into a topic and find something interesting to do.
Apparently I have successfully graduated academic primary school, so I was let
loose a bit more. I actually actively avoided involving my advisor in my new
endeavour until almost the very end, because I wanted to prove to myself that I can
find a worthwhile idea to work on and complete it without much help.</p>
<p>Again I was lucky, because I quickly found an interesting thing to investigate
due to the first paper we have written, which initially looked just neat, but not
that exciting. My research agenda in the new topic I was diving into was: taking
some ideas and a certain classification that we presented in the first paper,
and to see whether using these ideas has any effect in the different setting I
was now working in. It turned out that it did, and in my opinion, the results
from our first paper become much more interesting in this new context, because
they have further consequences that they do not have in the original context. I
worked it all out mostly on my own and proudly could show it to my advisor with
almost the whole puzzle already completed. With some help, I was able finish the
few proofs I was stuck on, so that this work of mine became the central part of
our fourth paper, the draft of which I completed by late summer, while
the final version was eventually accepted at a conference in winter by the end
of my second year.</p>
<h1 id="falling-back-to-earth"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#falling-back-to-earth" aria-label="Anchor link for: falling-back-to-earth"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Falling back to earth</h1>
<h2 id="hitting-more-walls"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#hitting-more-walls" aria-label="Anchor link for: hitting-more-walls"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Hitting more walls</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, this turned out to be my last academic success. After uncovering
and working out the connections that we published in the fourth paper, my advisor
suggested some more things I could look into in the same area. I worked on it for
almost half a year, twisting ideas around and thinking in spirals and circles,
but the solution, a working proof for statements both my advisor and I
conjecture to be true, did not come any closer.</p>
<p>After having such a successful streak of four papers, my own expectations
and my imagination of the expectations of others put me under a nagging of
pressure, as I felt that I should have something new to deliver soon. When you
are working in theory, the papers you publish is the only tangible proof of your
work and when you have no new results, then from the outside it is hard even to
see whether you are working at all (except for a growing pile of useless notes with
approaches and ideas that do not work).</p>
<p><strong>After having a boost in self-esteem due to the successes I had so far, my doubts
were coming back as time went on.</strong> I had no new publishable results and the
writing of the dissertation and planning of my future after it came onto the
horizon. My frustration was growing and each week it was becoming harder to stay
focused and try to find still unexplored approaches to solve my problems. <strong>The
four papers were enough for writing my dissertation, but I still had time
and of course I really wanted to keep up the pace, producing more results and
publications.</strong> I was still not sure whether to stay in science or leave for
industry, but having some colleagues producing twice as much output, I thought
that if I cannot keep up with producing papers on regular basis, I am wasting my
and everybody’s time and should clear the area for those obviously better people.</p>
<h2 id="to-postdoc-or-not-to-postdoc"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#to-postdoc-or-not-to-postdoc" aria-label="Anchor link for: to-postdoc-or-not-to-postdoc"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
To PostDoc or not to PostDoc</h2>
<p>By that time, my advisor had asked me whether I would like to stay for a year
longer after completing my PhD as a PostDoc, as he was writing a new proposal for
another PhD student, which could be combined with a year of more funding for me.
<strong>Usually, you work on PostDoc positions for 3-6 more years until you hopefully
get something permanent.</strong> Unfortunately, there are not many permanent positions
and essentially this path leads either to eventually becoming a professor, or
leaving for industry after wasting some more years of your life in stressful
PostDoc conditions. Unlike PhD positions, where you are not yet working in a
niche of a niche of science, as a PostDoc you already have “your thing”, are
firmly rooted in a certain subdiscipline, and as I understand it, when you are
offered a position, you cannot afford to decline if you want to stay in
business, so <strong>relocating to work at whatever institution that wants to fund you
is the norm.</strong></p>
<p>Having seen and met people at various stages of their research career and the
banners of <em>“excellence”</em> decorating the competitive air inside the ivory tower, I
have come to the conclusion that to succeed on this path you must:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>be ridiculously good at research</strong> so that your bright future is out of question, or</li>
<li>be a reasonably good researcher and also <strong>a good networker</strong>, building a publication
record and job security net out of possible people you can work with, or</li>
<li>have a <strong>high flexibility</strong> concerning your working conditions and <strong>high
tolerance</strong> for uncertainty concerning your future and life planning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The perspective of a nomadic and extremely competitive PostDoc life</strong>,
combined with my more recent inability to produce new results and the
understanding that my advisor will not always be around to help me out and
spoon-feed me good ideas, <strong>all of this was scaring me</strong>. Besides of ever
elongating your list of publications, you will also become responsible for
writing applications to get funding. You have to come up with larger-scale
projects and show results to the funding agency. And if you eventually are able
to get a professorship, you essentially become a scientific manager and have to
do various kinds of bureaucratic chores. <strong>Is this the life I would really want?
Am I willing to take the risk of failure on this path many years later?</strong></p>
<p>After weeks and months of introspection I came to the conclusion -
<strong>No. I love the <em>idea</em> of being a scientist, like many people love the idea
of having a dog.</strong> When you think about having a dog, you often overlook all the
inconvenience and work that having an animal causes. Or stated differently, if
you feel that those inconveniences are really a problem for you, then you probably
just should not have a dog, if you are a responsible person. I think it is even
more so with the inconveniences of working in science.</p>
<p><strong>I have seen people who made it and people trying to make it, and I just cannot
imagine walking in their shoes.</strong> I do not fit any of the three profiles that I
outlined above. Yes, you have as much intellectual freedom as is possible to
have, and like an artist creates art you can follow your research interests
(influenced by research trends and funding opportunities, but nothing is
perfect). But also like an artist, you live from gig to gig, from funding to
funding during a significant part of your life. And <strong>there is more to the job
than research and teaching</strong>, many things to do that you are not getting paid
for, like writing reviews, organizing conferences, doing administrative work at
your institution, and the list goes on.</p>
<p><strong>To be a good artist you need to have real passion for your work, you need
to love your work more than yourself, and it is the same in science.</strong> I lack
that passion and love. I enjoyed working on my topic, but I am not dreaming
about doing similar things for the rest of my life. I am interested in many
different things, but in no thing so deeply that I would agree to suffer for it.
<strong>If I could have a permanent position being a PhD student forever, I would
probably take it</strong>, but because this phase must come to an end and I am not
ready for the next step, it means that I have to go.</p>
<p>Concerning the PostDoc that my advisor wanted to offer me—I agreed, thinking
that I can use this additional year as a kind of extension of my otherwise
fast-paced PhD that was shaped by rules and structure of the RTG. I thought that
with one more year I could find out another thing or two and maybe write a last
paper, as after all, <strong>I do enjoy research</strong>. Leaving a year later would not
change much in the grand scheme of things and this extension would demand no
additional effort or risk-taking from me. But life decided that I won’t get this
gift. Even though the proposal of my advisor got positive reviews, apparently
the requested funding was cropped for other reasons and <strong>my one year PostDoc
was not granted. So after defending my dissertation my academic journey will
finally come to an end.</strong></p>
<h1 id="life-in-academia-a-summary"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#life-in-academia-a-summary" aria-label="Anchor link for: life-in-academia-a-summary"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Life in academia - a summary</h1>
<p>Even though it might not read that way, because I focused much on the struggle
I had and mistakes I made, I want to point out that all in all I had a <strong>really
great time during my PhD</strong>. I was very lucky to have this journey in a
supportive and friendly environment surrounded by amazing people and have really
nothing to complain about. In the end, this was an important chapter of my life
that taught me many lessons and enabled much personal growth. All the time I was
the only one standing in my way. I just eventually realized that <strong>the romantic
idea of being a professional researcher is not what it is like in practice</strong> and
that I cannot imagine continuing on this path due to lack of strength,
confidence and willingness to suffer for an unknown amount of time for an unsure
reward (a permanent researcher position) for which I am not even sure anymore
whether I really would want it.</p>
<p>I will really miss:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The artist-like freedom and creativity</strong>. No one is pressuring you to
deliver results next week and you can think about a problem for months, until
you either solve it or pick a different target to attack. No one cares how
you spend your time as long as your responsibilities are being done.</li>
<li><strong>The high that you feel after finally finding a solution to a problem</strong>,
after obsessing over it for a long time. These moments are rare and at the
same time what keeps you going.</li>
<li><strong>Being around awesome and very smart people</strong>. Talking about nerdy math things as
casual small talk during lunch breaks. The kind of people you are surrounded
with was for me one of the best parts of the whole experience.</li>
<li><strong>International travel</strong>. While this is a somewhat controversial topic from
an ecological point of view, the whole travelling in connection with scientific
exchange (which I would say is necessary, because virtual meetings have a
different feel to them and lack spontaneaus interactions) allowed me to visit very
interesting places.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will definitely not miss:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fighting alone with my problems</strong>. I had more fun working on the
topics where my advisor was more involved in and we talked more regularily,
than when working on the topics that I researched mostly all on my own (even
though the accomplishment of solving something without much help of the
advisor feels great). For me, no collaborations except for my advisor emerged,
so it was mostly lonely work.</li>
<li><strong>Sitting in boring and/or horrible talks</strong>. While I was somewhat enjoying
listening to other talks in the beginning, this changed over time. At
conferences, there are often sessions on topics I really don’t care about
and talks that are just really bad. Both my general interest in arbitrary
technical topics and my tolerance for bad presentations decreased a lot by
the end.</li>
<li><strong>Reviewing papers and advising students</strong>, when the
writing is rather bad. It is a quite exhausting and somewhat daunting task to
read someones work about a sometimes quite unfamiliar topic and being required to
assess its correctness. Especially, if you always doubt your own abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Impostor syndrome, feeling like a failure, and sleepless nights</strong>.
Everyone has their own weaknesses of character, I am tired of
fighting with mine. I think that this kind of job would not be healthy for
me in the long term. The gut feeling of dread I felt when thinking about the
challenges of pursuing a scientific career was the tipping point for
deciding that this kind of life is simply not for me, because I need more
security than this career path can offer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you do a PhD in a theoretical field, you (hopefully) will:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>understand how the scientific community is organized and how doing research works,</li>
<li>understand what it takes to be a successful professional researcher,</li>
<li>learn to think like a theoretician of your discipline,</li>
<li>learn to read advanced technical writing effectively,</li>
<li>learn to write down and present your insights and results understandably,</li>
<li>learn to organize and motivate yourself in the long-term and grow as a person, and</li>
<li>hopefully have some fun doing research and being a little cog in this glorious
machinery producing knowledge out of coffee (or your different favorite beverage).</li>
</ul>
<p>I enjoyed my time as a theoretical computer scientist in training and think that
I learned many skills that will also be helpful outside of active research. So if you
happen to have a good opportunity (according to the criteria I explained in the
beginning) and are looking for a challenging, but also uniquely rewarding life
experience, just give it a try and you will probably not regret it.</p>
