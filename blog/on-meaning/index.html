        <section class="body"><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This is based on a draft I wrote back in 2018, while “coming to terms with the
world” in my mid-20s, but I never actually published it. My views are still the same, but I
disliked the style of the writing. So this is a heavily revised, and I believe,
significantly improved version of the draft I have been sitting on for a long time.</em></p>
<p>In this post, I summarize my thoughts and views on multiple connected topics living in the
realm of philosophy. Nothing said here is new or original in any way, but it is a personal
conclusion of my own journey through the maze many others have walked through at some
point of their lives, on a personal years-long quest of finding satisfying answers.</p>
<h2 id="narratives-everywhere-yet-not-a-drop-of-meaning"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#narratives-everywhere-yet-not-a-drop-of-meaning" aria-label="Anchor link for: narratives-everywhere-yet-not-a-drop-of-meaning"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Narratives Everywhere, Yet Not a Drop of Meaning</h2>
<p>Existing is usually a messy and busy process. Most living beings, including humans, must
spend most of their time making sure that their basic needs are met, because if nothing
else, we are hard-wired for survival. For most, there simply is not enough room to stand
still, reflect, and ponder the “big questions”.</p>
<p><em>We often ask “why” assuming that there must be a clear and correct answer</em>, because
we are conditioned to expect that – when we were children, the whole world was packaged
up for us into some neat, straight-forward narrative that we were spoon-fed since we can
remember. We all start out with a very simplified black-and-white world view, but ideally,
over the course of our life, the picture is refined and enhanced by more and more shades
of grey, and possibly colors and shapes we could not comprehend or see before.</p>
<p><strong>For the most part, the following things are all different variations of the same:
education, nudging, praise and condemnation, propaganda and indoctrination.</strong>
All <em>socialization</em> and <em>cultivation</em> can be considered as various types of <em>mental
programming</em> we are subjected to throughout all of our lives - the main difference between
the methods is mostly in who is doing it, to whose benefit, whether it is voluntary or
not, and the intensity and type of force that is applied to achieve the desired result. A
human society is held together using a combination of these methods. Ideally, with the
goal to create cohesion, harmony, and a common ground for the benefit and flourishing of
everyone. Grand narratives and ideas provide meaning and purpose, as well as values to
orient our actions in some (hopefully) fruitful and beneficial direction.</p>
<p>In a rare moment of stillness and introspection, we occasionally dare to ask a “big”
philosophical question with personal relevance, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>why do I exist? (metaphysics)</li>
<li>what defines me? (ontology)</li>
<li>how should I live? (ethics)</li>
<li>what is the purpose of it all? (teleology)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are answers abound to all the “whys” and “hows” that come with the human condition.
<strong>Every society has a densely weaved net of narratives to catch a lost soul who got sucked
into these “scary” issues</strong>, and often this poor soul is happily pacified with the answers
provided by (depending on the society and person):</p>
<ul>
<li>their culture</li>
<li>their religion</li>
<li>their government</li>
<li>their favorite YouTube guru</li>
<li>their favorite best-selling “life philosophy” book</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone will quickly tell us what to do and what not to do. Someone will eagerly tell us
that these guys are good, and those are bad. The bad ones are those who do X. Well, the
good guys also do X, but this is something completely different. In general, doing X is
pretty bad. It is bad, because it leads to Y. Why Y is considered bad? Because <em>(pick one
ultimate discussion-killing argument)</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>since ancient times</em> Y is considered to be bad, in any culture, so it must be true!</li>
<li>brave <em>people gave their life</em> to make sure you never have to experience Y!</li>
<li>every sane person can <em>feel</em> that doing Y is wrong!</li>
<li><em>the almighty says so</em> in the holy writing, it is not for us to understand!</li>
<li><em>how dare you</em> even ask this question?</li>
<li>it is <em>obvious</em>! Are you stupid?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A whole marketplace of narratives to lure all those thirsty for clear answers</strong>,
claiming to provide a solid ground under your feet, orientation and comfort in the chaotic
maze that is existence, and bring them back on track.</p>
<p>At least on <em>some</em> track. But where is that track going? If you do not think for yourself,
others will do the thinking for you, and it often will not be with your interests in mind.
So sadly, many narratives are dishonest and are based on emotional manipulation, instead
of solid and convincing arguments. As many people are unable or unwilling to distinguish
reasonable (i.e. coherent, reasoning-based) from unreasonable (i.e. irrational or
unfounded) narratives or views, this is a massive problem. But I digress – this is not a
post about lack of (education on) <em>critical thinking skills</em>, or the dangers of populism,
fundamentalism, conspiracies and cults.</p>
<p>For some time I have been diving into and exploring branches of philosophy concerned with
issues like the ones metioned above. I was reading (and trying to understand)
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/">SEP</a> articles and trying to find a satisfying answer to the
quarter-life crisis questions that were haunting me at that time, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A human life is short – what is a life well lived?</li>
<li>Who and what deserves how much of my empathy and compassion?</li>
<li>Am I a good-enough person?</li>
</ul>
<p>all of which points into the very wide territory of ethics, and often intersecting with
metaphysics. Once I already dug deep into ethics, I also wanted to finally better
understand emotionally and morally loaded political issues such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>who and why decided about what is considered “basic human rights”?</li>
<li>who and why decided what kind of war is “just” and what kind of war is not?</li>
<li>who and why defines a conflict faction as “good rebels” or “bad terrorists”?</li>
</ul>
<p>For both kinds of questions, both the personal existential kind as well as the
higher-level and political kind, after lots of reading and running in circles, the
result was a creeping and silent acceptance of the truth that is rarely said out loud,
because it is inconvenient, scary, or often both.</p>
<h2 id="the-truth-about-values"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#the-truth-about-values" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-truth-about-values"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
The Truth about Values</h2>
<p>The uncomfortable truth is simple, but hard to digest. To truly <em>accept</em> it, is to
finally let go, and give up any further “existential search”. The very human nature
revolts against accepting the fact that</p>
<p><strong>all conceptions of value, meaning and purpose, without any exceptions,</strong></p>
<p><strong>are either evolved (and therefore not absolute or objective),</strong></p>
<p><strong>or artificially crafted (and therefore have an agenda).</strong></p>
<p>It is so hard to accept this because <strong>everyone wants to be validated in their actions</strong>, to
rest assured that there is a nice reference measure stick to check against, even if it is
mostly invisible. Everyone wants to feel good about achievements and choices, their life
and lifestyle.</p>
<p>Most people might find this stance intuitively appalling, maybe even accuse me of
nihilism, but in fact, nothing could be further from the truth. I did not change or
abandon any of my <em>actual views</em> on anything. I <em>do</em> have a strong moral intuition of what
is good and what is bad. <strong>What I was looking for was some <em>justification</em> and <em>approval</em>
for my already existing views, from some more <em>“objective”</em> point of view, which is not
<em>yet another</em> personal or popular opinion. What I realized over time was that I was
looking for a mirage.</strong></p>
<p>It started to dawn on me that foundations of ethics are almost as shaky and arbitrary as
theological attempts at proving the existence of god. While it seemed dubious to me
from the start, I found it increasingly difficult to take <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-realism/">moral
realism</a> seriously as a view<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-meta_arg-1"><a href="#fn-meta_arg">[1]</a></sup>. Any
school of ethics - deontological or teleological or anything else, once taken to the
extreme, suffers from certain edge cases that are either very counter-intuitive or
undesirable. But if a system of rules can consistently produce absurd consequences, this
cannot be a solid foundation to rely on.</p>
<p>If there was at least a system of ethics comparably solid to Newtonian mechanics – in its
scope, explanatory power and practicality – I might have a different opinion. But as it
stands, all I have seen are various concepts and ideas, all with some good arguments and
some very weak spots. As I learned, philosophy is really bad at providing an answer to
anything, but it is often good at suggesting <em>many</em> possible answers, and ask <em>many more</em>
even more complicated questions.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-phil_sci-1"><a href="#fn-phil_sci">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-value-of-truths"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#the-value-of-truths" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-value-of-truths"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
The Value of Truths</h2>
<p>I am not an ethical nihilist (i.e. the view “ethics is not real in the same way physics is,
so it does not matter”). <strong>Nihilism is an infantile, black-and-white point of view</strong>, akin
to the emotional and rebellious teenager who took the first step – <em>deconstructing</em> a
concept – but not the second – which is <em>rebuilding</em> something new from the ashes. Some
discover and accept the emptiness of the world, but never learn to move past the
discovered void – these are in danger of either becoming depressed or turn into horrible
and cynical people. Some are too scared or too lost, and hurry back into the safety of
their familiar narratives, if they can – these are in danger of becoming narrow-minded
conservative people, because they need to hold on tightly to their stories. Otherwise,
they fear, they (and the world) would fall back into the abyss. But there are other ways
forward and out of this hole, though.</p>
<p>I hold the pragmatic view of <strong>moral fictionalism</strong> (i.e. “ethics are a useful fiction,
so let’s continue to pretend it is real”). <strong>While all ethics is constructed, it exists
because it helped human societies to survive longer and better, so it is useful to invent
categories such as good and bad, and strongly associate them with emotions.</strong>
All unwritten rules, views and judgements, beliefs and tradition, are a huge cultural
achievement and cultural heritage of humanity. These mechanisms help to organize large
groups of people and help us create what we call “civilization”. Some rules and judgements
are eventually codified into actual written and enforced law, when we consider them
important and uncontroversial enough. In fact, I consider written law to be
“solidification of values”, like water turning to ice.</p>
<p>For certain situations and actions there exists an almost universal consensus on what is
“right and wrong” or “good and bad”. Most will agree that stealing and damaging property,
hurting and killing people is bad. Yet, <strong>the real world is mostly a place of grey moral
ambiguity</strong>. Situations are often too complex to have a clear, unquestionable judgement.
The ambiguity is very handy for the people playing the game of big politics. While
national politics in “civilized countries” is governed by law, international politics is,
by necessity, a mostly hypocritical and amoral game of chess and utility maximization
(ideally - for the benefit of a society, or worse - for its ruling class or elite), where
“values” are weaponized, shaped, turned and twisted into the shape needed to (de-)mobilize
people.</p>
<p>But even though I ultimately think that values are ultimately relative, it does not change
anything about the fact that <strong>I can and do feel strongly about <em>my</em> values</strong>, and still
believe that <strong>there are principles to live by, and if needed, worth to risk dying for</strong>.
But what does my emotional attachment to value judgements ultimately express? Of course
nothing but a personal preference. And I grant everyone the right to judge others and
their actions based on <em>their</em> values, because that is what values are for – expressing
our desires on how we want to live as a society and trying to instill those values into
others.</p>
<p>The red line is crossed if the values or narratives of others unreasonably endanger or
restrict my own freedom. <strong>But this exactly is what a pluralistic and democratic society
is – a system to enable the free expression of others, while at the same time protecting
opposing groups from each other</strong>. A free society with liberal values is in no way
<em>natural</em> or <em>obviously</em> superior – people holding these views must <strong>promote, fight and
defend</strong> this world view, or be crushed by more aggressive value systems. But this is
essentially what Karl Popper argued for in his famous <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Society_and_Its_Enemies">“The Open Society and
Its Enemies”</a><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-popper-1"><a href="#fn-popper">[3]</a></sup>.</p>

Relativism Requires Rational Reasoning</h2>
<p>Even though I reject any notion of fully objective or unquestionably correct ethical
views, and thus qualify as a certain kind of “moral relativist”, certainly there are
ideologies and societies that I believe to be abhorrent. There are also societies that I
can respect, but I would not want to live by their rules and prefer not to live in such a
society. Within the wide spectrum spanning from liberal to conservative views on a
multitude of social dimensions there are many ways to organize a society which (I can
imagine) can be stable, functional and make the members overall content with their lives,
even if their principles and ideas of life and happiness might not align with mine.</p>
<p>By not being able to express that something is “objectively” bad, nothing of actual
significance is lost. It is rather just consequent application of Ockham’s razor to
ethical reasoning. <strong>In practice, what is moral is defined by those with either the better
marketing or the bigger weapons anyway.</strong> Appealing to a higher, metaphysical and
unquestionable authority, or some truth of ineffable nature does not change <em>any</em> human
social dynamics, because humans do not even agree on what in fact such a truth or
authority would look like – making the whole “ultimate argument” circular. Pushing the
foundational justifications into the metaphysical, spiritual or emotional territory is
simply bad and lazy argumentation (or actually, lack thereof).</p>
<p>Yes, maybe I cannot say that “fascism is <em>objectively</em> wrong” because I don’t believe in
objective morality, but <em>do I need to</em>? Just like atheists can live ethical lives, I
can also <em>rationally</em> come to the conclusion and argue that, for various reasons and
according to many reasonable metrics, fascism is a pretty bad ideology. Or that murdering
people is not a smart thing to generally allow. At least, assuming that we can
agree that the goal is to build a flourishing and sustainable society. <strong>Giving up any
pretense about having some “moral high-ground” (secular, spiritual or otherwise)
just means being honest, open and transparent. It simply means not resorting to
cheap tricks whenever we have no convincing justification for our strong opinion.</strong></p>
<p>If everyone would be transparent about their deepest unfounded beliefs, the “ethical
axioms” and “value preferences” they derive all their judgements from, then we could have
an actual discussion about values, and <em>maybe</em>, sometimes, even convince each other.
Ethics is just politics with different means, and politics is about arguments,
compromises, and finding a mutually acceptable common ground. <strong>We have an innate ability
for <em>empathy</em> and <em>reason</em> - this is all we have, and it is all we need. Our moral
intuitions neither have to come from some ephemeral “out there”, nor do there needs to be
just one “correct” answer.</strong></p>
<p>I think that very much of what I strongly believe to be “good” can be justified and argued
for mostly based on empirical processes and rational considerations, instead of hiding
behind a lazy semi-spiritual and emotionally loaded veil. <strong>If there is any objectivity at
all in social values and morality, then it is the objectivity of having the facts –
scientific and historical – on your side, and this is the solid foundation on which
different views should compete.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-evolution-of-meaning"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#the-evolution-of-meaning" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-evolution-of-meaning"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
The Evolution of Meaning</h2>
<p>Values and meaning are closely related. We usually experience events and actions as
meaningful if they are positive according to the value system we and our social
environment is using. If what we do is <em>valued</em> by others and considered to be <em>good</em> (a
good deed, or good work), we get <em>praise</em> and <em>validation</em>, which makes our actions feel
<em>meaningful</em> to us. Thus, meaning makes us <em>feel</em> good.</p>
<p>Just as I believe that morality is a useful by-product of the evolution of human
societies, the same can be said about any concept of meaning. Meaning exists only inside
of some semantic framework. This framework can be given either implicitly by the consensus
of the surrounding society, or explicitly by religious and non-religious belief and value
systems. But all these are dynamically created and maintained. <strong>The continuous battle
between the so-called political left and right, between liberalism and conservativism, is
in the end nothing else but a continuous feedback loop for the adjustment of the mutation
rate of the value system a society runs on.</strong></p>
<p>While tradition (<em>“we always did it like this!”</em>) is a useful vehicle to retain successful
patterns, it can lead into dead ends. If the conditions change, the old patterns don’t fit
anymore and lead the society into a dysfunctional state. So we need the forces of progress
(<em>“enough is enough, we need change!”</em>) that try to update and adjust the inertial course of
a society, but not too violently, as a new untested path might also lead into a bad
direction. A good balance of these two forces is what makes a successful society,
i.e. ideally one where happiness and welfare are increasing.</p>
<p>We modify, abandon or introduce values in societies all the time. There are many examples
that even on the time scale of just one generation the values can shift quite
dramatically. Religious beliefs also adjust and adapt in the same way. Clearly, no
religion is now the same as a thousand years ago (only fundamentalist sects like to
<em>pretend</em> that they are). <strong>All societies, just like living things, struggle for survival
and need to adapt their shared beliefs and practices to an ever-changing environment.</strong></p>
<p>With this evolutionary picture in mind, I think it becomes clear that having more than one
kind of society is probably a good idea. <strong>Just like it is good for a population to have
a diverse gene pool, some societies and values work better than others for a given set of
social and environmental circumstances.</strong> Both politics and ethics can be very
context-dependent affairs, so it is quite helpful to have more than one possible answer
(and thus, (re)action) available at a time, at least if looking from the point of view of
all humanity.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-2-1"><a href="#fn-2">[4]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-the-absurdity-of-the-human-condition"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#dealing-with-the-absurdity-of-the-human-condition" aria-label="Anchor link for: dealing-with-the-absurdity-of-the-human-condition"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Dealing with the Absurdity of the Human Condition</h2>
<p>We live inside the matrix of the values we hold on to, which infuses our actions with
meaning and guides our actions like a force field. The quest for <em>“purpose”</em> is
then essentially just asking the same questions as before, but on a longer time scale –
such as a whole human life. Most of us crave for purpose and meaning in our lives.</p>
<ul>
<li>In retrospect, it provides justification: <em>“What I did was good and right”</em></li>
<li>In the outlook, it provides motivation: <em>“I want to do what is good and right”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Yet, on closer inspection, the whole notion of <em>“purpose”</em>, as typically understood, is
presupposing a lot of metaphysical baggage. Looking for <em>your true purpose</em> sounds very
much like looking for <em>your one true love</em> – naive romantic and idealistic ideas from
grand social narratives we are used to hear over and over.</p>
<p>Yet, at least to the best of our scientific knowledge, we are not existing for any
specific reason or purpose. We just randomly happened to be here, and the world likewise
just happened to be in the condition we find it in, however unsatisfying this may be. Not
only are we here without a reason, it also does not matter what we do with our life, and
it can end just as suddenly and unexpectedly as it started. It happens all the time –
people have accidents or get sick and, sadly, die. Even if there ever was a point to our
experiences, we have no way to know, and only time will tell whether we, our actions and
our very being, actually left any lasting mark on the world.</p>
<p>Some bitter irony is hidden in the fact that many mediocre and unremarkable people will be
remembered for a long time, while many truly exceptional people will be quickly forgotten.
We never get to see the whole effect our life had on the world – the sum of the myriad
little ways how we affected our environment and others, in good and in bad ways. <strong>Life is
this: popping into existence, doing and feeling some things, then vanishing back into
oblivion. Was it <em>good</em>, did we <em>succeed</em>? This is only up to us to decide.</strong> This is
existentialism in a nutshell. In <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre">Sartre</a>s
words: <strong>“existence comes before essence”</strong> – as all meaning is constructed, the only
meaning and purpose that should matter to us, the essence of our being, is the one we
define for ourselves.</p>
<p>There is the central notion of <em>the absurd</em> in the work of
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism">Albert Camus</a>. The absurd is manifested in the
futile and almost comical human drive to search for meaning in an uncaring and indifferent
universe. <strong><em>The absurd</em> is experienced whenever our inner universe of narratives and
meaning violently clashes with the chaotic and often cruel world.</strong></p>
<p>Camus thought that there are three main ways to deal with the absurdity of existence, the
aching and unfillable hole of meaning: (actual) suicide, philosophical suicide or
rebellion. What he calls philosophical suicide is choosing to accept some belief system as
real, quickly shove all uncomfortable truths and <em>the absurd</em> under a rug, and never
look there again, i.e. delude yourself, consciously or unconsciously. Clearly, this is
unacceptable for a thinking human being. Camus instead argues for a life where one accepts
and embraces the absurdity of the human condition.</p>
<p>The absurdist attitude can be summarized as: <strong>never forget that whatever we do has only
subjective meaning to ourselves and people around us – but as we are here anyway, you
can as well choose to enjoy the process.</strong> The act of <em>rebellion</em> in this context is to
reject (actual or philosophical) suicide and continue to live, and even create our own,
authentic and personal meaning, while laughing in the face of the cold universe. To me,
this seems to be the most brutally honest and at the same time life-affirming stance.</p>
<p><strong>Once we accept the world on its terms, we can realize ourselves on our own terms.</strong>
Only free of all delusions we are <em>truly</em> free – and can live our most authentic life.
There is no unquestionable authority to dictate our path, no story we have to follow.
Within the physical and circumstantial constraints we find ourselves in, we always have
the freedom to do as <em>we</em> think is right, as long as we are true to ourselves and are
ready to deal with the consequences. It means following rules that we believe to be
reasonable, and rebelling against rules we believe to be unreasonable. It means following
a path of our own choosing, and consciously adopt or reject narratives and values we live
by. So the existentialist answer to purpose and meaning would probably be: <strong>A life well
lived is an authentic and lucid life, lived fully on its own terms.</strong> I think that Sartre,
Camus and also Nietzsche probably could agree on that.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-3-1"><a href="#fn-3">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>There is an interesting
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/The%20Absurd%20-%20Thomas%20Nagel.pdf">essay</a>
about the absurd by Thomas Nagel. He says that it emerges from the fact that we can
always mentally “take a step back” from our current frame of reference and by “zooming
out” sufficiently far you eventually must arrive at such vast dimensions that whatever you
do bears no significance, hence our ability of “zooming out” from any level produces this
feeling. So effectively, the feeling of the absurd comes from our cognitive ability to
abstract from the immediacy and concreteness of our experience. To diminish this peculiar
psychological effect, he suggests to face the absurd with self-irony, instead of the “heroic
spite” that Camus proposed. <strong>We should not take ourselves and our life too seriously</strong>,
because the absurd experience comes up whenever the universe (and sometimes even
ourselves) undermines our subjective and pumped-up feeling of our significance. In other
words – while Camus prefers to embrace and try to enjoy the experienced “drama”, Nagel
advises us to minimize it in the first place. I think that in the end, it does not matter
– <strong>everyone must find their own unique way to resolve tensions between the objective
outer world and the subjective inner world.</strong><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-4-1"><a href="#fn-4">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Concluding this post with a nice image – the world is an intricate dance, orchestrated
by all the known and unknown rules governing the universe. We barely understand any of it,
many questions could be forever unanswerable, and the right answers unknowable. So all we
can ever do is watch attentively, admire the beauty of its unfolding, and try to take a
few steps ourselves. For no specific reason, we received a very special ticket to this
huge spectacle. If the seat and view we have are enjoyable, then maybe we should be
grateful that we have the opportunity to watch and participate in this grand eternal dance
for <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_no_aware">a brief and fleeting moment that we call life</a>.</p>

<p>I do see how one could try to argue from a utilitarian perspective that,
given the way people are, it could be beneficial to <em>claim and pretend</em> that moral
