Introduction: DIY disinfectant - can this be real?</h2>
<p>While researching the best ways for maintaining hygiene in
<a href="/blog/passive-hydroponics">passive hydroponics</a>, somebody suggested to try using
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypochlorous_acid">hypochlorous acid</a> ($\ce{HClO}$, or
equally common $\ce{HOCl}$) as an alternative to e.g.
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide">hydrogen peroxide</a> ($\ce{H2O2}$).
$\ce{HClO}$ has a short shelf life (days rather than weeks) and therefore was not
considered to be commercially viable until recently, however there is by now a lot of
evidence that it has
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7315945/pdf/main.pdf">very good properties</a> as a
safe general-purpose disinfectant. Furthermore, and this makes it especially interesting
to me, <em>it can be easily made at home using nothing but a cheap USB dongle, water and salt</em>.</p>
<p>The instructions that came with my 5$ device were a bit minimalistic and the whole thing
looked somewhat sketchy and questionable at first. I was wondering whether this is really
safe and whether it can work at all. According to the instructions, you just add around 2g
of regular kitchen salt into 100 mL of clean water, let the device run for around 10
minutes, and then you <em>supposedly</em> have a hypochlorous acid solution.</p>
<p>It turns out that these instructions <em>do</em> work and will give you some solution with
disinfecting properties, but without any adjustments and controls you do not really know
<em>what exactly</em> and <em>how much</em> you actually produced.</p>
<p>In this post I am going to unpack what is going on and complete the picture. I have to
confess that my knowledge of chemistry does not reach beyond first semester of university,
and even this was a while ago, but luckily you do not need more than that to understand
the whole system.</p>
<h2 id="theory-some-simple-redox-chemistry"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#theory-some-simple-redox-chemistry" aria-label="Anchor link for: theory-some-simple-redox-chemistry"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Theory: Some simple redox chemistry</h2>
<p>Those USB-powered dongles are often sold as “generators” for either hypochlorous acid or
bleach. They are actually simple
electrolysis systems consisting of a cathode, an anode and some resistors limiting
electron flow from anode to cathode, thus ensuring that the reaction stays within
controlled and safe parameters. What they <em>actually</em> are doing is driving anodic chloride
oxidation, producing chlorine at the anode surface, which immediately hydrolyzes in water.
The main reactions happening in this electrolysis system are what this section is about.</p>
<p>By dissolving salt in water, we have $\ce{H2O + NaCl -&gt; H2O + Na+ + Cl-}$, i.e. the ions
from the dissolved $\ce{NaCl}$ can freely move in the water and participate in reactions.
Assuming an idealized setup without any additives or contaminants in the water and salt,
and no ions from corroding electrodes, then this is all we have to consider in our
system. While the $\ce{Na+}$ ions will remain passive observers, you will see that the
$\ce{Cl-}$ ions are running the show.</p>
<p>Once we start the USB electrolysis device, at the <strong>cathode</strong> water is gaining electrons
and therefore is being <em>reduced</em>, producing some hydrogen gas in the process: $\ce{2H2O +
2e- -&gt; H2 + OH-}$. The hydrogen quickly bubbles out of the system, leaving the $\ce{OH-}$
ions behind and thus making the solution more alkaline, i.e. the <em>pH increases</em> in the
local area around the cathode.</p>
<p>At the <strong>anode</strong> there is more going on. We have some amount of oxygen being produced:
$\ce{2 H2O -&gt; O2 + 4 H+ + 4 e-}$. However, this reaction is not dominating (as long as
chloride is available) and any created oxygen, like the hydrogen at the cathode, quickly
forms bubbles and leaves the system. Until here all we have seen is simply the
electrolysis of water. Now with the added salt, the main action at the anode is that
<strong>chloride is being <em>oxidized</em></strong>: $\ce{2 Cl- -&gt; Cl2 + 2e-}$. The electrons are taken up by
the anode, whereas the oxidized chloride ions form chlorine.</p>
<p>Recall that water is always in an equilibrium $\ce{2 H2O &lt;-&gt; H3O+ + OH- }$ and the
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH">pH value</a> is just the negative decimal logarithm of the
$\ce{H+}$ concentration in the water, which is the same as the concentration of hydronium
cations $(\ce{H3O+})$. There are two reversible reactions that will happen now:</p>
<ul>
<li>$\ce{ Cl2 + H2O &lt;=&gt; H+ + Cl- + HClO }$</li>
<li>$\ce{ HClO &lt;=&gt; H+ + ClO- }$</li>
</ul>
<p>In which direction the balance is shifting depends primarily on the pH around the chlorine
molecules:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jorge-Vazquez-Arenas/publication/344209889/figure/fig1/AS:934680719286273@1599856657876/Fraction-of-aqueous-active-chlorine-species-as-a-function-of-pH-calculated-using-a.ppm" alt="Chloride species as a function of pH" /></p>
<p>As you can see, formation of $\ce{HClO}$ is strongly preferred at pH between 4 and 6. In
more acidic environments, production of chlorine is favored, which then also will start to
form bubbles and escape as $\ce{Cl2}$ gas (which is very toxic, so we definitely want to
avoid this). In alkaline environments, the hypochlorite form $\ce{ClO-}$ is preferred.</p>
<p>In our system the anode and cathode are close together and the water is continuously mixed
due to diffusion and also due to moving gas bubbles. Recall that at the cathode the pH is
increasing due to the removal of hydrogen and production of additional $\ce{OH-}$ ions.
Due to continuous mixing and diffusion, the chlorine produced at the anode will rapidly
react into $\ce{HClO}$ and $\ce{ClO-}$ due to the overall non-acidic environment.</p>
<p>If you started with roughly neutral salty water, in the end you will be left with a
somewhat alkaline solution, so at pH $\gt$ 8 you will end up with mostly $\ce{ClO-}$, which
is just <em>chlorine bleach</em>. Sometimes, as we also have sodium ions ($\ce{Na+}$) around,
for purely formal bookkeeping, they are grouped and accounted for together as <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hypochlorite">sodium
hypochlorite</a>, $\ce{NaClO}$, which is
the main ingredient of typical chlorine-based cleaning agents you can find in any
supermarket.</p>
<p>At the same time, at pH $\lt$ 10, a part of the chloride ions will be bound in the form of
$\ce{HClO}$, the <em>hypochlorous acid</em> and our desired disinfectant. As a disinfectant it is
<em>several times more effective</em> than bleach at the same concentrations, because it is
reacting faster and unlike the negatively charged bleach ions can permeate membranes and
thus enter cells.</p>
<p>There are more side reactions and transient molecules that can be and are produced in
negligible amounts, but there is one of special interest, because it is persistent:
the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorate">chlorate</a> ion $\ce{ClO3-}$.
The two main reasons for chlorate formation in our system are:</p>
<ol>
<li>over-oxidation of $\ce{ClO-}$ at the anode during electrolysis</li>
<li>decay of bleach during storage: $\ce{3 ClO- -&gt; ClO3- + 2 Cl-}$</li>
</ol>
<p>The first pathway is triggered by too high salt concentration (because it increases
conductivity in the solution), but also by properties of the electrodes and the whole
electrolysis setup (which we cannot influence directly and thus we have to trust the
engineering of our USB device<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-current_density-1"><a href="#fn-current_density">[1]</a></sup>). The second pathway is favored at high pH
and high $\ce{ClO-}$ concentrations and will happen slowly and naturally over time.</p>
<p>Chlorate, once formed, will stay and accumulate in the solution as an undesired byproduct.
There are regulations for chlorate concentration in drinking water due to risks by chronic
exposure, as it is known to
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bfr.bund.de/assets/01_Ver%C3%B6ffentlichungen/FAQ_englisch/chlorate-in-food.pdf">interfere with iodine uptake</a>.
Chlorate formation during storage is usually more important than during short and
controlled electrolysis runs, which is why self-made non-stabilized bleach should be used
fresh and should not be stored longer than a few weeks.</p>
<p>$\ce{HClO}$ has an even shorter shelf life because it is chemically reactive and decomposes
via multiple pathways, including oxygen evolution via $\ce{2HClO -&gt; O2 + 2Cl- + 2H+}$,
photochemical decay, and reactions with trace impurities. This is why $\ce{HClO}$
should be used fresh, ideally the same day.</p>

Run the Electrolysis</h3>
<p>Once you sourced the purest ingredients you can easily access, you can run the
electrolysis following the simple instructions that come with the device, i.e. <strong>dissolve
1-2g of salt in 100mL water and run the device for at most 10-15 minutes</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Adding more salt will <em>not</em> automatically increase free available chlorine (FAC) yield
at fixed device current limit and runtime</strong>, it will just increase corrosion of the
electrodes and risk of chlorate formation due to increased conductivity and current
density. Adding not enough salt on the other hand will make the current flow and thus the
electrolysis unstable. For that reason you should stay in the recommended window for best
results.</p>
<p>Longer running times provide diminishing returns while posing risks similar to high salt
concentration, so again it is better to <strong>run the process only as long as necessary to
reach the target concentration</strong>, which you can easily check using a little piece of the
free chlorine test strips after turning off the device.</p>
<p>You can double the amount of salty water and the running time to get twice as much
solution with about the same FAC concentration. This can quickly become impractical,
unless you want to produce a lot of less concentrated solution. The FAC production rate is
limited by the USB dongle, not the volume of salty water, so by scaling up the amount of
salty water at a fixed running time you are simply diluting the result.</p>
<p>Now what is a good target concentration? Such a solution is not really intended for
long-term storage, so there is no point in concentrating it further to counteract decay.
Furthermore, reactions such as chlorate formation prefer higher concentrations (becoming
relevant especially above 1000 ppm), so it is better to keep it as high as necessary and
as low as possible.</p>
<p>For most household and personal disinfection uses, concentrations of a few hundred ppm are
more than sufficient, many applications require way less. Therefore <strong>roughly 200-300ppm
of free chlorine is a good target</strong><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-chlorinetest-1"><a href="#fn-chlorinetest">[4]</a></sup> for the stock solution (which can be
diluted further, depending on the use-case). With our equipment, it is anyway neither
possible to have more precision than that, nor a way to reach significantly more without
harming the device (by accelerated electrode corrosion) or risking other problems
(such as chlorate formation).</p>
<p>The electrolysis process itself should be very unspectacular - all you should see ever
happening is small or larger bubbles forming around the USB dongle, nothing more. The
solution should remain fully clear the whole time and there should also be no strong smell
at an arm’s length distance. If anything changes except for some bubbles coming from the
electrodes, you should turn the device off immediately. In any case <strong>make sure to do all
of this in a well-ventilated room</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Under no circumstances you should add any acid before the electrolysis is completed</strong>.
Doing so you risk formation of chlorine gas, which is preferred by the system in an acidic
environment. This is probably the most safety-critical caveat to keep in mind. Apart from
this it is quite unlikely that something can go seriously wrong, assuming that you tried
to avoid adding impurities to your solution that could facilitate unwanted side reactions
and contaminate the result.</p>
<h3 id="pick-your-poison-dialing-in-the-ph"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#pick-your-poison-dialing-in-the-ph" aria-label="Anchor link for: pick-your-poison-dialing-in-the-ph"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Pick Your Poison: Dialing in the pH</h3>
<p><strong>Use your pH meter to see where you stand with respect to acidity.</strong> Now is the point
where you decide whether you want to make bleach or disinfectant. As discussed in the
theory section above, in the solution we produced the bleach is most likely
dominating.</p>
<p>For <strong>bleach</strong> ($\ce{ClO-}$) with maximized purity and shelf life, you can
stabilize it in your solution by <em>carefully</em> adding some soda (both baking and washing
soda will do) in small amounts and stirring until you reach a <strong>pH in the range between
9-10.5.</strong> Going above that is not helpful. On the contrary, it increases the likelihood of
side reactions such as chlorate formation, which accelerates decay.</p>
<p>For <strong>disinfectant</strong> ($\ce{HClO}$), <em>very carefully</em> titrate an acid while stirring
continuously and watching the pH meter until you reach a <strong>pH in the range between 5-6</strong>.
This will maximize the $\ce{HClO}$ concentration in the solution. If you have no
experience with this process, prepare a very diluted acid solution so that each drop
changes the pH by at most ~0.1 in 100mL of pure water before titrating the real solution.
Remember that <strong>bleach and acid should never be mixed in an uncontrolled way</strong>, as they
can react violently and produce toxic chlorine gas ($\ce{Cl2}$).</p>
<p>Concerning the choice of the acid, phosphoric acid is the most predictable, stable and
chemically robust in terms of side reactions in solution. If the HClO is not for immediate
use, this is the only acceptable choice out of the three considered here. Both citric acid
and acetic acid are organic acids that react with and consume some of the HClO over time,
thereby reducing the effective HClO concentration and pH stability. Out of these two,
citric acid is the more robust choice and is still very accessible in supermarkets as a
cleaning agent.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-vinegar-1"><a href="#fn-vinegar">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the produced concentrations, both bleach and HClO will smell like a “swimming pool” when
you hold your nose over it, but neither should be aggressive or irritating. HClO will
smell slightly more “biting” at the same concentration. Pay attention to the smell just
before and after titration to learn the difference. Any sudden sharp or irritating smell
during acid titration is a warning sign indicating $\ce{Cl2}$ formation.</p>
<h3 id="shelf-life-and-storage"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#shelf-life-and-storage" aria-label="Anchor link for: shelf-life-and-storage"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Shelf Life and Storage</h3>
<p>If you do not use it immediately or have produced too much, you can store the solution in
a cool and dark place, preferably in a HDPE plastic container. Make sure that the
container is <strong>not</strong> closed airtight to avoid pressure build-up due to slow gas formation.</p>
<p>Glass bottles are acceptable for short-term storage of low-concentration HClO, but are not
ideal for bleach, especially at higher concentrations. If glass is used, avoid metal caps
to prevent corrosion and contamination.</p>
<p>You can use a <strong>HClO solution</strong> within <strong>hours up to a few days</strong> at useful disinfecting
strength and a <strong>bleach solution</strong> within <strong>weeks to a few months</strong> after production,
depending on creation and storage conditions.</p>
<p>Technically, you can also store the solution as alkaline bleach and acidify on-demand to
$\ce{HClO}$ for its better disinfectant properties. However, the bleach will be already in
the process of decay and may contain increasing amounts of by-products such as chlorate.
Such $\ce{HClO}$ should ideally <em>not</em> be used for sensitive applications with direct
contact to humans and you should check remaining the chlorine concentration before use
after longer storage.</p>
<p>In case you <em>really</em> want to store the solution, you should target around 500-800 ppm and
use some soda as described above to raise pH to around 10. Stored properly (opaque HDPE
plastic bottle, ideally in the fridge) it could last for many months and whenever you need
HClO, you can dilute and acidify just as much as you need.</p>
<h3 id="some-applications-of-hclo"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#some-applications-of-hclo" aria-label="Anchor link for: some-applications-of-hclo"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Some Applications of HClO</h3>
<p>There is some overlap where both $\ce{HClO}$ and $\ce{ClO-}$ can be used, but as a rule of
thumb, you should strongly prefer $\ce{HClO}$ for any use-case with direct contact to
living beings, probably you should only use bleach where $\ce{HClO}$ does not make more
sense, and I struggle to come up with any realistic household scenario. For that reason, I
will only consider $\ce{HClO}$ in this section.</p>
<p>My favorite <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7315945/">HClO survey</a> lists various
examples of reported concentrations that have been successfully used in various hygienic
and clinical use-cases. Quoting directly from the paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HOCl has been shown to inactivate a variety of viruses including coronaviruses in less than 1 minute. At a concentration of 200 ppm, HOCl is effective in decontaminating inert surfaces carrying noroviruses and other enteric viruses in a 1-minute contact time. When diluted 10-fold, HOCl solutions at 20 ppm were still effective in decontaminating environmental surfaces carrying viruses in a 10-minute contact time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it is good enough for hospitals, it certainly is good enough for use at home.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-virocide-1"><a href="#fn-virocide">[6]</a></sup>
Beside the application as a <strong>surface disinfectant</strong>, the same paper further reports about
successful use of HClO as <strong>wound disinfectant, hand disinfectant</strong> and even <strong>mouth
rinse</strong> at concentrations between 50-200 ppm, and similar recommendations can be found in
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/2025-eml-expert-committee/addition-of-new-medicines/a.16_hypochlorous-acid.pdf">this
document</a>.</p>
<p>From this we can conclude that at those concentrations produced in our setup (i.e. around
200-300 ppm), there is no danger from skin contact with the HClO solution, if correctly
produced. I would still wear gloves to avoid contact if I am not sure that it is below 200
ppm. I will probably try to optimize my electrolysis times to reliably land around 100-200
ppm without the need for control by test strips and further dilution.</p>
<p>For <strong>drinking water</strong> concentrations below 5 ppm are considered effective and safe, and
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://iris.who.int/server/api/core/bitstreams/189a2802-2d16-4813-a82d-f23b59c2b396/content">WHO</a>
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/wash-documents/wash-chemicals/chlorine.pdf">papers</a>
suggest that the water will taste horrible long before the allowed chlorine content is
above safe limits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] the guideline value is 5 mg/litre (rounded figure). It should be noted, however, that this value is conservative, as no adverse effect level was identified in this study. Most individuals are able to taste chlorine or its by-products (e.g. chloramines) at concentrations below 5 mg/litre, and some at levels as low as 0.3 mg/litre.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For applications in <strong><a href="/blog/passive-hydroponics">hydroponics</a></strong>,
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://learn.hydrobuilder.com/hypochlorous-acid-growing-applications/">this site</a>
suggests using 200-500 ppm (soak + rinse) for cleaning the growing medium and 2-4 ppm
continuously to prevent algae and fungi, assuming a re-circulating system.
Another site states more generally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While hypochlorous is safe to spray on plants and add to their water sources, it is important to monitor the chlorine levels. Chlorine concentrations of over 4 ppm can have detrimental effects on the plant system, and long-term exposure of greater than 2 ppm hypochlorous can also be toxic to some plants. We always recommend testing hypochlorous on a small sample of plants before applying it to your entire crop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, there is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030442380400113X">a paper</a>
indicating that especially in combination with ammonium ($\ce{NH4+}$) even concentrations
of 0.5 ppm can be problematic, and especially in passive systems without circulation I’d
rather stay below the stated concentrations.</p>
<p>So it turns out that typically used conservative concentrations for drinking water of
0.5-2 ppm are already on the higher end when considered for plant irrigation, among other
things because nutrients for plants consist (unsurprisingly) very different substances
than what you would typically find in water intended for human consumption.</p>
<p>Addition of concentrations of 2-10 ppm in water that is intended for later consumption by
plants or humans should be considered to be a shock treatment in case of suspected
contamination, assuming clear water, except for at most minor biofilm. Water that is
visibly contaminated should be filtered or disposed anyway.</p>

Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the beginning I was asking - can this be real? The answer is clear: Yes, it is indeed,
and I think that it’s <em>amazing</em> that you can produce such a useful chemical as $\ce{HClO}$
at home cheaply and easily!</p>
<p>This little project certainly sparked my interest in exploring more practical DIY
chemistry at home. Maybe at some point I will try to replace the USB dongle with a
system out of a battery pack, resistors and suitable

and also experiment with other simple and easily controllable reactions with useful
products.</p>
<p>Until then, stay safe and healthy!</p>

<p>According to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/12/4754">this paper</a>
the optimal current density is 3.18 mA/cm² and going beyond 4 mA/cm² increases
formation of by-products, at least for the used graphite electrodes. My USB dongle
pulls ~225 mA at 5V and obviously has very small electrodes. This implies that the
current density here is much higher, but I hope the engineers knew what they were
doing. If you build your own electrolysis setup, I’d suggest to research recommended

<p>Given an anode with <em>A</em> cm² and a target current density <em>j</em> within
the very safe up to still reasonable range of 1-5 mA/cm², we have a target current $I = j
\cdot A$. Assuming we run from 3-4 AA batteries or USB, we will have $V_{supply}$ in the
range 4.5-6 V. Estimating the cell voltage $V_{cell}$ with 2.5V (the real cell voltage can
be measured a posteriori across the resistor using $V_{cell} = V_{supply} - V_{resistor}$),
the needed resistance is given by $R_{target} = \frac{V_{supply}-V_{cell}}{I}$.
For example, with a 60 cm² anode, 6V power supply and desired current density of 2
mA/cm², we want a current of 120 mA, which would require a resistor with $\approx$ 29
$\Omega$. Adding some safety margin to account for the idealized cell voltage, we can just
use around 50-60 $\Omega$ of resistance. This also matches up with the more naive
estimation of $R = U / I = 6V / 0.12A = 50 \Omega$. Final caveat is to use a resistor
rated for enough power. We can estimate in the worst case for resistor dissipation
(i.e. ignoring $V_{cell}$) that $P = U\cdot I = 6V\cdot 0.12A = 0.72W$, so choosing a
resistor rated for $\geq$ 2W is more than sufficient. <a href="#fr-circuit-1">↩</a></p>
