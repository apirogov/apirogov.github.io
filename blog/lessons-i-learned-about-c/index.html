        </ul><section class="e-content body"><p>I recently worked on my
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/EvolBioInf/macle">first non-trivial C project</a> during my
student job in bioinformatics research. I already knew enough C to hack things
together, like my <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/apirogov/lold">LoL Shield daemon</a>, which
still suffers from some bugs but works fine, but this time I tried to do
everything right™.</p>
<p>Now, in other languages you can get along just fine using just a REPL and some
printf-debugging, but as I learned, when programming C, life is just a lot
easier if you know how to use your tools. As it turns out, there is not much you
need to know to get great benefits. So what follows are some of the lessons I’ve
learned and my overall impressions of working with C.</p>
<h2 id="use-valgrind"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#use-valgrind" aria-label="Anchor link for: use-valgrind"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Use valgrind</h2>
<p>Valgrind is wonderful – just put <code>valgrind</code> in front of your program and
arguments and wait for it to finish. Valgrind slows down execution considerably,
so it might be a good idea to use not the biggest input available for such a
test run. In the end valgrind spits out statistics about memory allocation and
in case of (possible) memory leaks gives a backtrace to the line where the
corresponding memory block was allocated. It helped me to find not only leaks,
but also a lot of stupid double frees or index over-/underruns that I would
probably not find ever otherwise, because valgrind tells you how many bytes away
from an allowed memory block your invalid read or write went. And it is a great
feeling to see the <em>“no leaks are possible”</em> message! A fact that you often take
for granted in all those fancy garbage-collected languages we have at our
disposal today.</p>
<h2 id="use-gdb"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#use-gdb" aria-label="Anchor link for: use-gdb"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Use gdb</h2>
<p>Well, this point is probably obvious to most. The thing is, I do not like
debuggers. At least I thought so. This may be because of rather negative
usability experiences I had with them when using IDEs. Well, now I see that
probably the problem are bloated IDEs and not debuggers. I learned my basic
gdb-ABC from <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="http://www.unknownroad.com/rtfm/gdbtut/">this</a> tutorial and some
googling, which is enough to start being productive. Just don’t forget to
disable optimization and add debugging information (<code>-O0 -g</code>). Overall, the
experience was quite pleasent and the gdb CLI is very polished. At the very
least, you can locate the place where your program crashes and often inspecting
variables prior to the crash is enough to see the mistake. But in some cases I
still find printf-debugging to be the less tedious solution. Especially if I
want a trace of multiple variables in e.g. each run of some loop.
I don’t know of a fast way to do the same with a debugger, but maybe I just have
to use them more.</p>
<h2 id="profiling"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#profiling" aria-label="Anchor link for: profiling"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Profiling</h2>
<p>Add <code>-pg</code> to both compiler and linker options, and your program will be compiled
in a way that it creates a <code>gmon.out</code> file which contains profiling information.
Just run <code>gprof your_program gmon.out &gt;  result.txt</code> to extract a human-readable
summary about the run. I used
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/08/gprof-tutorial/">this</a> tutorial about basic
gprof usage, but I must admit, I didn’t use it much. Still, it is useful to know
how to find bottlenecks easily.</p>
<h2 id="unit-testing-in-c"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#unit-testing-in-c" aria-label="Anchor link for: unit-testing-in-c"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Unit-testing in C</h2>
<p>Setting up unit-testing in C is surprisingly simple. I settled on a variant of
<em>minunit</em> – all it takes is one additional header file with some macros and
adapting your Makefile. There are several variants of this micro-test-framework
(if you can even call it this) floating around the web, e.g.
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex30.html">this one</a>. If you set it up in
a similar way, each test suite will be compiled into a separate executable and a
shell script will run them all and log the results. All the tests can be run
through valgrind, so that correct memory usage is tested for free as well. I
modified the macros so that success and failure of tests is shown in green and
red, respectively, it is much more fun and cheerful with colors! ;)</p>
<p>I have not enough discipline (yet?) to do <em>test-driven development</em>, but what I
found to be very useful was what I’d call <strong>test-driven debugging</strong>. I had a
few situations where I simply could not find the bug, I could hit my head
against the wall. Then I had an enlightenment – when reasoning does not lead me
anywhere, probably <em>my assumptions are wrong</em>! So I’ve added tests for all
functions involved. And of course (as usual) the problem was in a completely
different place. For me, finding a nasty bug is the biggest motivation to write
tests, and sometimes it is the only solution. Hence, test-driven debugging.</p>
<h2 id="my-testing-recipe"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#my-testing-recipe" aria-label="Anchor link for: my-testing-recipe"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
My testing recipe</h2>
<p>The problem with testing is that it only protects from mistakes you have thought
of or already made (and added a test against it, afterwards). Coming from
Haskell, I am a fan of randomized tests in the style of
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck">QuickCheck</a>. So for the more
complex algorithms I added generators for big random inputs and sampled them for
test cases, where the complex and efficient implementation is compared against a
simple naive solution. The randomized tests are complementing some regular tests
(especially edge cases) with known expected values and some exhaustive tests for
rather small inputs. The combination of these kinds of tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>regular tests (hard-coded results)</li>
<li>small exhaustive tests (against naive implementation)</li>
<li>bigger randomized tests (against naive implementation)</li>
<li>all above through valgrind</li>
</ul>
<p>gives me a warm fuzzy feeling about the correctness of my code, when all the
test suites pass and everything is green.</p>
<h2 id="clang"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#clang" aria-label="Anchor link for: clang"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Clang</h2>
<p>Clang is awesome and probably all the good things you heard about it are true.
The error and warning messages are among the best I’ve ever seen from a compiler
(and even colorful!). So there is no excuse for not using clang at least for
development. I would even use it if it was just for the helpful warning
including a hint for the correct format string when using <code>printf</code>! As a
bonus, clang includes a linting tool, <code>clang-format</code>, which is also easy to
use. Unfortunately it lacks some customization options I would like, but that
are just minor things.</p>
<h2 id="minimize-global-state"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#minimize-global-state" aria-label="Anchor link for: minimize-global-state"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Minimize global state</h2>
<p>Well, to be honest, this is a lesson I already knew before, but I applied it in
C as well – I rather have some more parameters in a function, than introduce a
global variable. In the end, the only globally accessible data I introduced were the
program args, because they are coupled with a lot of stuff and I really don’t want to
pass them to every function explicitly. This makes testing easier and the code
is less spaghettified.</p>
<h2 id="use-c99-to-the-full-potential"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#use-c99-to-the-full-potential" aria-label="Anchor link for: use-c99-to-the-full-potential"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Use C99 to the full potential</h2>
<p>Previously, I basically just used C99 as standard to be able to declare
variables everywhere (again, a feature taken for granted normally!). Now I
know that the C standard library (this small and laughable collection of
functions) does include some useful things – you get a bool type, a set of sane
fixed-size integer types and some useful constants and macros associated with
them. In fact, I made a master-header that includes about two-thirds of the C
standard library, as you need it all the time anyway.</p>
<h1 id="impressions"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#impressions" aria-label="Anchor link for: impressions"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Impressions</h1>
<p>Well, in the end I may not have some unique perspective to offer, but I can
confirm many of the good and bad aspects people often mention.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-like-about-c"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#what-i-like-about-c" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-i-like-about-c"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
What I like about C</h2>
<h3 id="speed"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#speed" aria-label="Anchor link for: speed"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Speed</h3>
<p>Damn, it is fast. It’s a nice feeling to run a blazing-fast binary
that does in seconds what would take minutes in your fancy modern language of
choice.</p>
<h3 id="control"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#control" aria-label="Anchor link for: control"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Control</h3>
<p>No garbage collector kicking in, no magic performed by the runtime. Even though
it may be not really true, it really does feel like you have full control over
the machine.</p>
<h3 id="portability"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#portability" aria-label="Anchor link for: portability"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Portability</h3>
<p>Well, not exactly a feature of C, but just a matter of fact. But probably this
point is moot, if your target are just regular recent x86-family processors. But it is
good to know that you can compile for, say, your MIPS wireless router.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-hate-about-c"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#what-i-hate-about-c" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-i-hate-about-c"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
What I hate about C</h2>
<h3 id="makefiles"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#makefiles" aria-label="Anchor link for: makefiles"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Makefiles</h3>
<p>Writing the Makefile for the project was like always a major PITA and more or
less consisting of copy-pasting snippets from various tutorials and
Stackoverflow questions, then poking around until it does what I want. I
probably really need to RTFM some day, because writing Makefiles seems not to be
a skill you just pick up on the fly. For me, it is just a necessary evil. Maybe
I am just spoiled by other languages. Of course, this point does not apply to C
itself, but Makefiles are the usually used with C or C++ projects and are the
de-facto standard build system, so I think this is fair.</p>
<h3 id="historical-madness"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#historical-madness" aria-label="Anchor link for: historical-madness"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Historical madness</h3>
<p>Separation of .c and .h files, always needing to change function
signatures in two different places, needing macro guards to prevent
multiple includes of the same file, needing a prototype signature, if you use a
function before the definition. The resulting amount of boilerplate code.
Working with strings. These are just examples from a huge list of small
annoyances. Not even asking for the accomplishments of PL theory and
engineering of the last decades. I know that all of this is historical baggage we
now can’t change. I just hope that someday <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> or
something similar will succeed and replace C. Probably won’t ever happen, but
one can always dream!</p>
<h2 id="my-conclusion"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#my-conclusion" aria-label="Anchor link for: my-conclusion"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
My Conclusion</h2>
<p>While you can get along without fancy tools in e.g. Haskell or Ruby most of the
time, in C <em>appropriate tooling is indispensable</em>. It also makes programming in C
is a lot more bearable and fun. You still probably need almost twice as much
time to accomplish the same thing and have a lot more ways to make mistakes, but
in the end it pays off. I am not afraid of SEGFAULTs and memory corruptions
anymore, but I still rather wouldn’t use C without a very compelling reason to
do so.</p>
