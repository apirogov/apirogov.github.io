Intro: Learning to Synth</h2>
<p><em>NOTE: If you just want to see the MB2 patch, feel free to skip this section.</em></p>
<p>In recent years I have been musically focusing on playing drums (mainly motivated by
having a guitar-playing friend to jam and cover some songs with), but a few months ago I
got the urge to play some keys again. Only now I wanted something <em>else</em> than classical
piano (which I used to play for many years in my youth), something that allows me to play
or write music that I also would <em>enjoy listening to</em>. So I came to the embarrassingly
late realization that maybe I should check out synthesizers (and maybe learn some basics
of jazz improv for fun).</p>
<p>After first buying a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thomann.de/de/arturia_keystep_37.htm">Keystep 37</a> and
playing around for a while with <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://tytel.org/helm/">Helm</a> and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/">Surge
XT</a> in <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reaper.fm/">Reaper</a> to learn the
basics and get a feeling for synthesis, I felt that I need a hardware synth – some
instrument as physical and immediate as my
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.roland.com/de/products/td-11kv/">TD-11KV</a> drum set<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-1-1"><a href="#fn-1">[1]</a></sup> and my
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thomann.de/de/roland_fp_30x_bk.htm">FP-30X</a> piano. Tweaking knobs only using
the mouse in the DAW is too limiting and unergonomic, while mapping them out to a MIDI
controller sounds annoying and cumbersome. Also, after work I strongly prefer to get away
from the computer screen, mouse and keyboard. Long story short – after lots of
research<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-2-1"><a href="#fn-2">[2]</a></sup>, I have acquired a little synth collection:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thomann.de/de/roland_s_1.htm">Roland AIRA S-1</a></li>
<li>an <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thomann.de/de/asm_hydrasynth_explorer.htm">ASM Hydrasynth Explorer</a></li>
<li>an <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thomann.de/de/arturia_minibrute_2_noir.htm">Arturia Minibrute 2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I might not strictly need the S-1, but it was far too tempting – even if I end up only
using it as an ultra-portable toy. The Hydrasynth, however, is certainly a <em>dream</em> of a
synthesizer. I guess technically, there is no need for anything else<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-3-1"><a href="#fn-3">[3]</a></sup>, but just out of
curiosity, I bought a used Minibrute 2 for a decent price, so I could also dip my feet
into analog semi-modular synths.</p>
<h2 id="let-s-patch-the-minibrute-2"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#let-s-patch-the-minibrute-2" aria-label="Anchor link for: let-s-patch-the-minibrute-2"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Let’s Patch the Minibrute 2</h2>
<p>Without further ado, here’s a fun little patch I created with the Minibrute 2, probably
the most complex one so far. Mainly, because I ran out of patch cables after wiring up all
of the 8 cables that came with the Minibrute.</p>
<p><img src="https://pirogov.de/blog/analog-synth-patch-minibrute-2/mb2_patch01.jpg" alt="The Minibrute 2 patch" />
<audio style="width: 100%;" controls="1" controlslist="nodownload nofullscreen noremoteplayback" type="audio/mp3" src="mb2_patch01.mp3">Your browser does not support the audio tag.</audio></p>
<p>I hope the actual patching should be clear enough based on the image, and in the following
I will try to explain what is actually going on here.</p>
<h3 id="envelopes"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#envelopes" aria-label="Anchor link for: envelopes"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Envelopes</h3>
<p>By default, the <em>AD Envelope</em> modulates the volume, while the <em>ADSR envelope</em> modulates
the filter cutoff of the synth. Here, the ADSR envelope is patched to modulate the volume
instead, and is set to produce a rather pad-like sound. The now free <strong>AD envelope</strong> is
repurposed to be a <strong>third LFO</strong> (by setting it into <em>Loop</em> mode). Its attack and decay
are set to produce another sawtooth-like wave, and with the attack set to zero, the <strong>AD
Decay</strong> effectively controls the LFO rate.</p>
<h3 id="green-areas"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#green-areas" aria-label="Anchor link for: green-areas"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Green Areas</h3>
<p>The third LFO (i.e. the AD envelope) is used to modulate the <strong>filter resonance</strong>. The
<strong>Resonance</strong> and <strong>RM</strong> knobs are essentially defining the minimum and maximum
resonance, i.e. the range in which the AD-based LFO can modulate it.
This creates a <em>layer of clicky sounds</em> at a speed controlled by the <strong>AD Decay</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="blue-areas"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#blue-areas" aria-label="Anchor link for: blue-areas"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Blue Areas</h3>
<p><strong>LFO2</strong> is attenuated by <strong>Att 1</strong> and is responsible for a <em>slow filter sweep</em> (i.e.
it controls the filter cutoff frequency). The <strong>LFO2 rate</strong> controls the modulation
speed, the <strong>Att 1 knob</strong> controls the modulation strength (i.e. frequency interval around
the center), while the <strong>cutoff knob</strong> defines the center of the modulation range.</p>
<h3 id="yellow-areas"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#yellow-areas" aria-label="Anchor link for: yellow-areas"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Yellow Areas</h3>
<p>The mod wheel is patched to control a <em>tremolo effect</em>, instead of the standard vibrato
(i.e., to modulate volume instead of pitch). The output volume is modulated by <strong>LFO1</strong>,
which is attenuated by <strong>Att 2</strong>. The <strong>LFO1 rate</strong> sets the tremolo frequency, the <strong>mod
wheel</strong> can be used to control tremolo between none at all and the maximum strength, which
is defined by the <strong>Att 2 knob</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-personal-impressions"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#conclusion-personal-impressions" aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion-personal-impressions"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Conclusion: Personal Impressions</h2>
<p>I do like the straight-forward ergonomics of the Minibrute 2 – the immediacy of a
<em>knob-per-function</em> design does have some magical appeal. Also, it is the only compact
synth I own with <em>full-sized keys</em> and it has really nice mod and pitch bend wheels. All
my other devices at most have touch strips for modulation, and I can say that I really do
enjoy and prefer the feeling of a <em>sturdy metal wheel</em>. The full-size keys are nice to
have, but I already have a digital piano with MIDI output – no compact synth keybed can
beat that anyway. The sequencer and arpeggiator look to me exactly like the ones provided
by the Keystep, so no surprises here.</p>
<p>The Arturia-specific <em>Brute factor</em> knob is neat, but I found no practical use for turning
it up more than halfway, when it goes into heavy feedback mode that is hard to tame or
control. Up until the midpoint though, I do like turning it up to add more warmth and
fatness to the sound. I think that the Minibrute <em>sounds pretty good even without any
external effects</em>, and that is (from what I’ve heard) not always a given for for synths in
the entry-to-mid price range.</p>
<p>I can appreciate the Minibrute 2 for what it is, but after playing around with it a bunch
of evenings, I got the feeling (actually, a confirmation) that I am neither an
analog nor modular synth kind of person. It is well known that analog synths are
much more expensive than similarly sounding and equally feature-rich digital synths, while
being more clunky and heavy at the same time. Having no irrational prejudice against
digital synths, <em>the only advantage of an analog synth that I see is its suitability for a
(semi-)modular setup</em>.</p>
<p>Only that I noticed that I <em>really</em> dislike having to deal with cables (it is such a mess
and PITA), and <em>really</em> miss the ability to save my work. I have let the Minibrute sit
untouched and collect dust for <em>weeks</em> before writing this up, because I wanted to
properly document this patch (mostly for the “tricks” I used and/or came up with) before
moving on to the next experiment. And this patch is still not much at all, compared to what
other people happily deal with in their modular setups, and even compared to what I can
easily do with my Hydrasynth – <em>without</em> any limitations and inconveniences caused by
cables, and <em>with</em> the ability to quickly save the result and restore it later. As I
apparently tend to gravitate towards more complex patches and prefer powerful modulation
capabilities, and at the same time despise the cable mess, analog and modular gear does
not make much sense for me.</p>
<p>I don’t regret buying the Minibrute at all, and it taught me a thing or two about
old-school analog patching and my own synth preferences, but I am not sure whether I am
going to keep it. Neither do I have the desk space, nor can I see a real need for it. My
Hydrasynth is hands-down better as the ultimate sound design workstation, whereas the S-1,
paired with the Keystep, already fill the simple, light-weight and super portable niche in
my setup.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-4-1"><a href="#fn-4">[4]</a></sup> In any case – it was quite some fun playing with you, Minibrute 2!</p>

<p>I’ve been owning and using the TD-11KV for over 8 years now, and I have almost no
complaints. The investment to have all drums as mesh-heads was absolutely worth it,
giving me a close-to-natural drumming experience without neighbors you share a wall
with starting to hate you (except, possibly, because of the bass pedal). <a href="#fr-1-1">↩</a></p>

<p>If all you knew before were are classical instruments, the market and available
options for synthesizers and related gear is absolutely overwhelming (even more so for
software instruments / VST plugins). It’s quite some effort to cut through the
noise and hype, to see what actually matters in general and also for me personally. <a href="#fr-2-1">↩</a></p>

<p>Except maybe a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.audiothingies.com/product/micromonsta2/">Micromonsta 2</a>,
for the bi-timbrality. Sadly, it’s super difficult to get the hands on one (making
me want it even more). I guess I’ve caught a mild case of
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gear_acquisition_syndrome">GAS</a>. To keep it in check,
my rule of thumb is to only buy new gear that is not redundant in my setup and fills
some real gap or has a special strength or feature. <a href="#fr-3-1">↩</a></p>
