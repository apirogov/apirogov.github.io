Introduction</h1>
<p>You may ask yourself, why do you need a type system? It is possible to
get work done without it just fine, the types are only in the way. There
are many popular programming languages which do not require adding type
information to variables all over the place and it still works, right?
If this is what you think of when you hear “type system”, I assume that
you have never used a powerful one.</p>
<p>A sane, advanced type system, as mainly found in ML, Haskell or other
functional languages is a very useful tool in the process of software
development. It rejects code which is obviously broken, offers
additional documentation for functions and needs only minimal hints, as
there are algorithms which figure out the types of different expressions
all by themselves, most of the time (a feature known as <em>type
inference</em>). A strong, static type system also makes refactoring easier
— if an API changes, the code will not pass the type checking in all the
affected places. Being constrained by the bounds of a type system forces
the developer to construct models which are, at the very least,
self-consistent.</p>
<p>But before we can dive into the simply typed lambda calculus as a
fundamental example of a type system, we first need to understand its
predcessor, the <em>untyped lambda calculus</em>, as introduced by Alonzo
Church in 1936 and shown to be equivalent in expressiveness to
Turing machines by Turing in 1937. Language features like
partial application, currying and the whole notion of
higher-order-functions, i.e. functions as values root directly from the
lambda calculus, making it a worthy object of study for everyone
interested in the development of programming languages.</p>

The Untyped Lambda Calculus</h1>
<h2 id="syntax-and-evaluation"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#syntax-and-evaluation" aria-label="Anchor link for: syntax-and-evaluation"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Syntax and evaluation</h2>
<p>The pure untyped lambda calculus has a very simple grammar.</p>
<p><em>Syntax of $\lambda$-calculus:</em></p>
<p>$\tt t ::= x \mid \lambda x.t \mid t\medspace t$</p>
<p>Which means that a valid lambda term is either a <em>variable</em>, an
<em>abstraction</em> or an <em>application</em>. The intuition shall be to see an
abstraction as function definition and application as function
application, where the right term is used as the argument for the left
term. Note that for readability we will use parentheses around terms,
although they are not a formally defined part of the calculus. If
omitted, assume that an abstraction opens a pair of parentheses and
extends to the end of the expression.</p>
<p>A variable is <em>bound</em> in a term if its name is used in a lambda
abstraction it is embedded in, otherwise the variable is <em>free</em>. In
$\tt \lambda x.x\ y$ the $x$ is bound and $y$ is free.</p>
<p>Also notice that in the pure lambda calculus there are no primitive data
types like integers, booleans, etc. so the only possible value of a
variable is unevitably another lambda term and the things we can
possibly “compute” are just other lambda terms as well. Another
interesting property is that the defined “function” syntax just allows
one argument, what seems rather limiting on the surface, but is a
restriction easy to circumvent.</p>
<p>The only form of computation possible in the lambda calculus is <em>beta
reduction</em> which in fact, is just function evaluation — substituting the
variable of an abstraction with the argument on the right side. A
reducible term, i.e. of the form $\tt (\lambda
x.\ t_1)\ t_2$ is also called <em>redex</em> which is just a shorthand for
<em>reducible expression</em>. For such a substitution we will write
$\tt [x \mapsto t_2] t_1$, to be read as “substitute all occurences of x
in term $t_1$ with term $t_2$”.</p>
<p>There is a number of different ways to define the rules and order of
term evaluation, we will use the <em>call-by-value</em> strategy. It means,
that we start on the outside, we will recursively evaluate the terms,
left to right, until it is no longer possible and if the resulting
expression forms a redex, we will substitute the variable in the
abstraction on the left with the <em>value</em> on the right, removing the
binder (keeping only the substituted body) and proceed with evaluation
until we reach a term which is not a redex. In this context we call
non-reducible terms just values, as we have no other kind of data and
such a term is as “flat” and “primitive” as it can get in this setting.</p>
<p>If not careful, when substituting terms which contain the same variable
names in different contexts, we can accidently change the meaning of the
expression:</p>
<p>$$\tt [x\mapsto z](\lambda z.x) = (\lambda z.[x\mapsto z]x) = (\lambda z.z)$$</p>
<p>Here we changed the meaning from a constant function to an identity
function, which should not be possible for obvious reasons. So a
limiting rule for substitution is that we only allow it if the variable
bound by the abstraction is not a free variable in the right-hand term.
A different approach would be to rename conflicting bound variables in
the abstraction prior to substitution, which is also called <em>alpha
conversion</em>. Terms which are the same except of the choice of variable
names, i.e. with identical structure, are called <em>alpha equivalent</em>.</p>

Working with the Lambda Calculus</h2>
<h3 id="currying"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#currying" aria-label="Anchor link for: currying"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Currying</h3>
<p>As mentioned, our abstractions in the lambda calculus can take only one
argument. But we can easily define a function which takes an argument
and returns a different function, with one variable already substituted.
We just apply our arguments one at a time:</p>
<p>$$\tt (\lambda x.\lambda y.x\ y)\ a\ b \to (\lambda y.a\ y)\ b \to a\ b$$</p>
<p>What we did is that we defined an abstraction that takes one argument,
returning an abstraction that takes a different argument and returns the
first argument applied to the second. Then we successively did the
substitutions $\tt [x\mapsto a]$ and $\tt [y\mapsto b]$. This is
effectively a function that takes another function and an argument and
returns the supplied function applied to the argument.</p>
<p>This technique is commonly called <em>currying</em>, attributed to Haskell
Curry, but actually is thought to go back to the mathematician
Moses Schönfinkel. In reverse, pre-applying a function with one
or more arguments before passing it somewhere else is called <em>partial
application</em>.</p>
<h3 id="encoding-booleans"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#encoding-booleans" aria-label="Anchor link for: encoding-booleans"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Encoding booleans</h3>
<p>The only values in the pure $\lambda$-calculus are abstractions, but to
actually give our computations some meaning outside of the abstract
realm of the calculus, we somehow need at least to encode some kind of
values we want to regard as true or false. Without extensions to the
calculus we can do nothing else but just assign some specific terms a
meaning and make sure that they behave the way we want. Fortunately
Church also solved this problem:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\tt tru &amp;= \tt \lambda t.\ \lambda f.\ t \newline
\tt fls &amp;= \tt \lambda t.\ \lambda f.\ f
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>We simply interpret a function that takes two arguments and returns the
first one as <strong>true</strong>, and a similar function which returns the second
one as <strong>false</strong>. This is a wise choice, as now we can easily define
logical operators exploiting this definition of our <em>Church booleans</em>:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\tt not  &amp;= \tt \lambda b.\ b\ fls\ tru \newline
\tt and  &amp;= \tt \lambda b.\ \lambda c.\ b\ c\ fls \newline
\tt or   &amp;= \tt \lambda b.\ \lambda c.\ b\ tru\ c \newline
\tt test &amp;= \tt \lambda l.\ \lambda m.\ \lambda n.\ l\ m\ n
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>The <code>not</code> function is straight forward, <code>and</code> takes two booleans and
evaluates the first with the second and <code>fls</code> as argument. If <code>b</code> is
true, it will return <code>c</code>, whose value corresponds to the value of
<code>b</code> $\land$ <code>c</code>. If <code>b</code> is false, it will return its second argument <code>fls</code>,
which is also correct. A similar logic is behind the definition of <code>or</code>.
The <code>test</code> function simply applies the second and third arguments to the
first, giving us a kind of if-condition, but with the inconvenience that
both “branches” (arguments two and three) will be evaluated before it is
decided which one will be returned, because of our call-by-value
semantics. We can fix this by wrapping our arguments in dummy
abstractions to prevent further evaluation before we want it and then
apply the returned abstraction to anything, in order to unpack the
wrapped expression.</p>
<h3 id="encoding-numbers"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#encoding-numbers" aria-label="Anchor link for: encoding-numbers"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Encoding numbers</h3>
<p>We can even represent natural numbers:</p>
<p>$$\begin{aligned}
\tt c_0 &amp;= \tt \lambda s.\ \lambda z.\ z \newline
\tt c_1 &amp;= \tt \lambda s.\ \lambda z.\ s\ z \newline
\tt c_2 &amp;= \tt \lambda s.\ \lambda z.\ s\ (s\ z) \newline …\end{aligned}$$</p>
<p>Here our natural number is a function which applies an arbitrary
function to a denoted zero value, thus the number of applications of <code>s</code>
corresponds to the number we mean. This representation is known as
<em>Church numerals</em> and an interesting fact is that our definition of
$c_0$ is alpha equivalent to the Church boolean <code>fls</code>, which can be
useful for some applications. Now we need some functions to manipulate
such numbers:</p>
<p>$$\begin{aligned}
\tt scc  &amp;= \tt \lambda n.\ \lambda s.\ \lambda z.\ s\ (n\ s\ z) \newline
\tt plus &amp;= \tt \lambda m.\ \lambda n.\ \lambda s.\ \lambda z.\ m\ s\ (n\ s\ z) \newline
\tt times &amp;= \tt \lambda m.\ \lambda n.\ m\ (plus\ n)\ c_0\newline
\tt iszro &amp;= \tt \lambda m.\ m\ (\lambda x.\ fls)\ tru\end{aligned}$$</p>
<p>The function <code>scc</code> generates the successor (increments) a numeral,
taking a numeral <code>n</code> and returning a new numeral, with <code>s</code> applied one
more time than it is applied by <code>n</code> itself. <code>plus</code> works similarily,
applying <code>s</code> first <code>n</code> and then <code>m</code> times to <code>z</code>, implementing addition.
Multiplication can be defined as repeated addition, as demonstrated in
the definition of <code>times</code> — we exploit the fact that we can use an
arbitrary function to evaluate our numerals, so that after full
evaluation we do get the result we want. We can test whether a value is
zero by evaluating a numeral with the constant false function and true
as our zero value — if it is zero, we just get true, as the function is
not applied, and otherwise we get false, because the function will be
applied to a value.</p>
<p>Subtraction is also possible, but is quite a bit more complicated both
in definition and evaluation, so we skip it here. With a test for zero
and a predcessor function it is also possible to define a function
testing two numerals for equality by verifying that subtraction in both
directions returns zero.</p>

Beyond the pure calculus</h2>
<h3 id="real-booleans-and-numbers"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#real-booleans-and-numbers" aria-label="Anchor link for: real-booleans-and-numbers"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Real booleans and numbers</h3>
<p>Instead of struggling with Church booleans, we can extend our calculus
with real ones. So we define <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> to be valid, atomic
values (in contrast to <code>tru</code> and <code>fls</code> above, which just stand for a
lambda abstraction that itself can be evaluated). To put our booleans to
use, we also introduce the if-expression of the form
<code>if t then t else t</code>, where $t$ is any lambda term. Our evaluation rule
for these forms is - first evaluate the condition. If it is <code>true</code>,
replace the if-expression with the <code>then</code>-branch, if it is <code>false</code>,
replace the expression with the <code>else</code>-branch.</p>
<p>We can mix our real booleans with the Church booleans, as they are easy
to convert:</p>
<p>$$\begin{aligned}
\tt realbool &amp;= \tt \lambda b.\ b\ true\ false \newline
\tt churchbool &amp;= \tt \lambda b.\ if\ b\ then\ tru\ else\ fls
\end{aligned}$$</p>
<p>Real numbers can be also introduced rather easily – we add the new
syntactic terms <code>0</code>, <code>succ t</code> and <code>pred t</code> and semantically we treat a
chain of <code>succ</code> applications to <code>0</code> as the number represented. Whenever
<code>succ</code> and <code>pred</code> meet, they form a redex which is removed in the
evaluation step. Again, the difference to Church encoded numbers is that
these tokens are not lambda abstractions, but are a distinct part of the
language.</p>
<p>A real programming language would never use Church encoded data types,
because atomic primitive data types in a machine-friendly format can be
processed much faster with hardware support. Still, the Church encodings
are an interesting showcase to see what can be done even in the pure
calculus.</p>
<h3 id="and-more"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#and-more" aria-label="Anchor link for: and-more"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
…And more</h3>
<p>There are many useful extensions one can add to the lambda calculus,
e.g. more primitive base types, complex data types like tuples and lists
and also different kinds of <em>syntactic sugar</em>, which is some convenient
notation for a construction that can be expressed in the basic terms,
but in a more verbose way. Also there are techniques to enable recursion
(and thereby support looping) in the lambda calculus, but all these
things are out of scope of this essay. The transition to a fully fledged
functional language is rather fluent, but for us, as also in most
formal, theoretical settings, we want to keep our object of study simple
and, in our case, just focus on our topic of interest — types.</p>

<h2 id="motivation"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#motivation" aria-label="Anchor link for: motivation"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Motivation</h2>
<p>Now what does prevent us from passing a boolean value instead of a
number when calculating something? Nothing does. The evaluation will
either stop, as we have no rule to handle such a situation, or,
depending on the setting, it will continue and produce meaningless
results, which is even worse. So we need a way to tell our compiler or
interpreter what we expect to get, something that can be easily checked
automatically and which will reliably reject invalid, <em>ill-typed</em> input.
We want to accept <em>well-typed</em> expressions, ones which can be evaluated
correctly and result in a meaningful value. So we need to expand our
definition of $\lambda$-calculus.</p>

<p>We want to assign to each function a type of the form $T_1 \to T_2$,
which is to be read like: the function takes an argument of type $T_1$
and evaluates to a value of the type $T_2$. So $\to$ acts as a <em>type
constructor</em> giving us a new type from the <em>type variables</em> $T_1$ and
$T_2$, which themselves can stand for any other constructed type of this
form or a base type like <code>Bool</code>, that can not be decomposed any further.
The $\to$ operator is right-associative, so $A\to B\to C$ is to be read
as $A\to (B\to C)$. Now the syntax changes just a little:</p>
<p><em>Syntax of simply typed $\lambda$-calculus:</em></p>
<p>$\tt t ::= x \mid \lambda x\textbf{:T}.\medspace t \mid t\medspace t$</p>
<p>We just annotate a type to every lambda abstraction. Note, that ‘simply
typed’ just means that the only way to construct types is $\to$, whereas
there exist extended systems that have additional operators which can
not be expressed in terms of $\to$. The simply typed lambda calculus is
abbreviated as $\lambda^\to$ and has been first developed by Church in
1940.</p>
<h3 id="semantics"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#semantics" aria-label="Anchor link for: semantics"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Semantics</h3>
<p>Now we need to establish some rules about correct type assignment to
terms. Let $\Gamma$ be the set of assumptions about the types of some
terms like e.g. free variables (this is our <em>typing context</em>), then
$\tt \Gamma \vdash t : T$ means ‘under given assumptions the term t has
the type T’. The context can also be empty and can be omitted in this
case. The notation with the horizontal line used below is a more
readable form of implication ($\Rightarrow$) with the left side on top
and the right on the bottom. This notation is used to specify <em>deduction
rules</em>.</p>
<p>The first rule is trivial and just formalizes the fact that a variable
has the type we assume it to have in the typing context:</p>
<p><em>Typing of variables (T-Var):</em></p>
<p>$$\frac{\tt x:T \in \Gamma}{\tt\Gamma \vdash x : T}$$</p>
<p>The next rule is about abstractions and says that if under the
assumption that $x$ has the type $T_1$ the term $t_2$ has the type
$T_2$, we deduce that an abstraction taking $x$ as argument and having
$t_2$ as its body has the type $T_1\to T_2$:</p>
<p><em>Typing of abstractions (T-Abs):</em></p>
<p>$$\frac{\tt \Gamma,x : T_1 \vdash t_2 : T_2}{\tt \Gamma \vdash \lambda x : T_1. t_2 : T_1\to T_2}$$</p>
<p>The third rule takes care of application, saying that if we have an
abstraction and apply it on a term of the expected type, the result will
have the type of the body of this abstraction:</p>
<p><em>Typing of applications (T-App):</em></p>
<p>$$\frac{\tt \Gamma\vdash t_1 : T_{11} \to T_{12}\hspace{5mm} \Gamma\vdash t_2 : T_{11}}
{\tt \Gamma \vdash t_1\medspace t_2 : T_{12}}$$</p>
<p>Additionally we can assign our real booleans and numbers a type. Note,
that the rule for <code>if</code> has to enforce that both branches of the
condition have the same type.</p>
<p><em>T-True, T-False, T-If:</em></p>
<p>$$\tt true : Bool \quad false : Bool \quad
\frac{\tt\Gamma\vdash t_1 : Bool \quad \Gamma\vdash t_2 : T \quad \Gamma\vdash t_3 : T}
{\tt \Gamma\vdash if\medspace t_1\medspace then\medspace t_2\medspace else\medspace t_3 : T}$$</p>
<p><em>T-Zero, T-Succ, T-Pred, T-IsZero:</em></p>
<p>$$\tt 0 : Nat \quad
\frac{\tt\Gamma\vdash  t_1 : Nat}{\tt\Gamma\vdash  succ\ t_1 : Nat} \quad
\frac{\tt\Gamma\vdash  t_1 : Nat}{\tt\Gamma\vdash  pred\ t_1 : Nat} \quad
\frac{\tt\Gamma\vdash  t_1 : Nat}{\tt\Gamma\vdash  iszero\ t_1 : Bool}$$</p>

<p>To see the rules in action, we can deduce</p>
<p>$\tt f:Bool\to Bool \vdash \lambda x:Bool.\ f\ (if\ x\ then\ false\ else\ x) : Bool\to Bool$</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em></p>
<p>$$\frac{\frac{\frac{\tt f:Bool\to Bool \in f:Bool\to Bool}

Properties of typing</h2>
<p>From the rules given above we can get <em>type safety</em>, a guarantee that
well-typed expressions are valid expressions which do not get stuck
during evaluation. Safety of a type system is shown by two theorems, the
<em>progress</em> and <em>preservation</em> theorems. The progress theorem makes sure
that a well-typed term is either a value or can be evaluated one step
further, so that a well-typed term is never in a stuck, undefined state.
The preservation theorem says that if a well-typed term takes one step
of evaluation, the term we get is also well-typed. Both theorems
together ensure a clean evaluation chain, if we start out with a
well-typed expression.</p>
<p><em>Progress:</em></p>
<p>Suppose <code>t</code> is a closed, well-typed term (that is,
$\tt\vdash t : T$ for some <code>T</code>). Then either <code>t</code> is a value or else
there is some <code>t’</code> with $\tt t\to t’$.</p>
<p><em>Preservation:</em></p>
<p>If $\tt \Gamma \vdash t : T$ and $\tt t\to t’$, then
$\tt \Gamma \vdash t’ : T$.</p>
<p>Both theorems can be basically shown using structural induction and some
helping lemmas. The reasoning is not so difficult to follow, but is
quite long. Because of this the proofs are omitted and can be found in
the book by Pierce.</p>
<p>Another property of typing is that we can remove all type annotations,
thus converting a term from simply typed to the untyped calculus, and
the evaluation behaviour stays the same. This fact is used in real-world
programming languages in the way that the types can be checked before
compilation and can be removed in the process, when it is verified that
everything is ok. The reverse action to this <em>type erasure</em> is <em>type
reconstruction</em>, which is the procedure of finding a possible type of a
term which has incomplete typing information. If it is possible to find
a type, then the given term is <em>typable</em>, if it is not, then the code is
most likely broken (or the compiler has insufficient information and can
not compute the type, which can happen in more expressive type systems).</p>
<h2 id="system-f"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#system-f" aria-label="Anchor link for: system-f"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
System F</h2>
<p>Now consider the following situation - we need to define a function
which applies another numeric function twice. No problem:</p>
<p>$$\tt double = \tt \lambda f:Nat\to Nat.\ \lambda x:Nat.\ f\ (f\ x)$$</p>
<p>Later we notice, that such a function would also be useful for booleans.
Okay:</p>
<p>$$\tt doubleBool = \tt \lambda f:Bool\to Bool.\ \lambda x:Bool.\ f\ (f\ x)$$</p>
<p>Now what if we want to define this function for any type? In the defined
calculus there is no way to express this. We would have to define
exactly the same function for every type we want to use it with! What we
want is something like Generics in Java, or Templates in C++. The
general name for this feature (’write once, use with any type’) is
called <em>parametric polymorphism</em> and it helps solving this ugly code
duplication problem in an elegant way. So we extend our calculus to the
next level, which is called <em>System F</em>, first discovered by Jean-Yves
Girard in 1972:</p>
<p><em>Syntax of System F:</em></p>
<p>$\tt t ::= x \mid \lambda x\textbf{:T}.\medspace t \mid t\medspace t \mid\medspace \lambda X.t\medspace \mid\medspace t\ [T]$</p>
<p>The uppercase letters denote type variables while the lowercase mean
terms. The newly introduced forms are called <em>type abstraction</em> and
<em>type application</em>, which work similarily to the regular abstractions
and applications, but on type variables (now type variables are part of
our language, whereas before we could only use concrete types). Type
abstraction and application also form a redex, substituting the type
variable in the body of the abstraction with the type argument given in
the brackets: $\tt (\lambda X.t_{12})\ [T_2] \to [X\mapsto T_2]t_{12}$</p>
<p>Now we know how to evaluate these new forms, but we still need to
provide new typing rules for this new kind of data. So we introduce
<em>universal types</em>, which have the general form $\tt\forall
X.T$ and are required to say that a function is polymorphic, i.e. works
with any type we provide. Because we now have a new type constructor
besides $\to$, this calculus is also called <em>second-order lambda
calculus</em>. The missing typing rules are:</p>
<p><em>Typing of type abstractions (T-TAbs):</em></p>
<p>$$\frac{\tt \Gamma,X \vdash t_2 : T_2}{\tt \Gamma \vdash \lambda X.\ t_2 : \forall X. T_2}$$</p>
<p><em>Typing of type applications (T-TApp):</em></p>
<p>$$\frac{\tt \Gamma \vdash t_1 : \forall X. T_{12}}{\tt \Gamma \vdash t_1\ [T_2] : [X\mapsto T_2] T_{12}}$$</p>
<h3 id="examples"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#examples" aria-label="Anchor link for: examples"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Examples</h3>
<p>In System F we can again define things like Church encoded booleans and
numerals, which would not be possible in the simply typed calculus, as
they would be not general enough or just impossible to formulate
well-typed. For example, the identity function can be formulated
universally now and instantiated for any type:</p>
<p>$$\begin{aligned}
\tt id &amp;= \tt \lambda X.\ \lambda x:X.\ x &amp;\rm type\ \forall X. X\to X \newline
\tt idNat &amp;= \tt id\ [Nat] = \lambda x:Nat.\ x &amp;\rm type\ Nat\to Nat\end{aligned}$$</p>
<p>Likewise, we can define a polymorphic <code>double</code> function:</p>
<p>$$\begin{aligned}
\tt double &amp;= \tt \lambda X.\ \lambda f:X\to X.\ \lambda x:X.\ f\ (f\ x) &amp;\rm type\ \forall X. (X\to X)\to X \to X\newline
\tt dblBool &amp;= \tt double\ [Bool] &amp;\rm type\ (Bool\to Bool)\to Bool\to Bool \newline
&amp;= \tt \lambda f:Bool\to Bool.\ \lambda x:Bool.\ f\ (f\ x)\end{aligned}$$</p>
<p>But we are not limited to instantiating polymorphic functions to
concrete types, we can also substitute with yet another polymorphic type
expression:</p>
<p>$$\begin{aligned}
\tt quad &amp;= \tt \lambda X.\ double\ [X\to X]\ (double\ [X]) &amp;\rm type\ \forall X. (X\to X)\to X\to X\end{aligned}$$</p>
<p>What did happen here? We just defined a polymorphic function which
applies a given function four times, by applying our polymorphic
<code>double</code> function twice! Does that really work? Let’s check the types –
$\tt double\ [X\to X]$ expands to a function with the type
$\tt \forall X. ((X\to
X)\to X\to X)\to (X\to X)\to X\to X$, $\tt double\ [X]$ has the type
$\tt \forall X. (X\to X)\to
X\to X$. Now as we partially apply the latter <code>double</code> to the first, the
remaining type is again $\tt \forall X. (X\to X)\to X\to X$. If you are
still not convinced, look at the expansion of this function:</p>
<p>$$\begin{aligned}
\tt quad &amp;= \tt \lambda X.\ double\ [X\to X]\ (double\ [X]) \newline
&amp;= \tt \lambda X.\ (\lambda f:(X\to X)\to X\to X.\ \lambda a:X\to X.\ f\ (f\ a))\ (double\ [X]) \newline
&amp;= \tt \lambda X.\ \lambda a:X\to X.\ double\ [X]\ (double\ [X]\ a) \newline
&amp;= \tt \lambda X.\ \lambda a:X\to X.\ (\lambda g:X\to X.\ \lambda b:X.\ g\ (g\ b))\ (double\ [X]\ a) \newline
&amp;= \tt \lambda X.\ \lambda a:X\to X.\ \lambda b:X.\ double\ [X]\ a\ (double\ [X]\ a\ b)
\newline
&amp;= \tt \lambda X.\ \lambda a:X\to X.\ \lambda b:X.\ a\ (a\ (a\ (a\ b)))
\end{aligned}$$</p>
<p>As you can see, parametric polymorphism is a quite powerful means of
abstraction and one can express a lot in System F. So it is probably no
big surprise that the Haskell programming language, when stripped of all
syntactic sugar during compilation, is an extended form of System F.</p>
<p>The preservation and progress theorems still hold for System F, giving
us type safety, whereas type reconstruction is undecidable in many
cases, so type annotations often can not be omitted. Programming
languages based on System F often add restrictions to what terms and
types are allowed, to keep a partial type reconstruction feasible.</p>

Type theory and OOP</h2>
<p>One could get the impression that type theory is only practiced and
relevant in the realm of functional programming. But an important branch
of development of lambda calculi is calculi with <em>subtyping</em>, a concept
first explored formally by Reynolds and Cardelli in
the 1980’s. To every object oriented programmer the intuition and
meaning of subtyping should be apparent – it means that if we have a
function working on vehicles, we also expect it to work with a car, or a
train, which are special types of a vehicle. This is deeply connected to
the notion of <em>inheritance</em> in OOP – we want to be able to give our
types (the object classes we defined) a hierachy and to be able to use
functions on a whole category of inputs which are related in a way. The
formalism for this is the <em>subtyping relation</em>, which comes with its own
set of deduction rules specifying which types can be treated as more
general types, by ignoring their specialization in the context of a
given function. There also have been multiple efforts to prove type
safety of Java, first by Drossopoulou, Eisenbach and Khurshid in
1999, using calculi with subtyping which resemble different subsets
of Java.</p>
<h2 id="type-theory-and-logic"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#type-theory-and-logic" aria-label="Anchor link for: type-theory-and-logic"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Type theory and logic</h2>
<p>Worth to mention is another fascinating property that can be seen in
many type systems, which is called Curry-Howard-Correspondence, as it
was first described by Haskell Curry in 1958 and William Alvin
Howard in 1980. It is an observation, that types can be seen as
propositions and terms having that type are a proof of these
propositions. So a proposition can be proved by constructing a term with
that type. This bridge between constructive mathematical logic and
computer science is being researched and already has lead to the
development of tools like <em>Coq</em>, which is a functional programming
language with its primary purpose being an interactive theorem prover –
it assists the user in the formulation of assertions, helps finding
proofs in form of programs and automatically checks their correctness by
type-checking the proof-program.</p>
<p>The type systems used in this setting are mostly based on calculi with
<em>dependent types</em>, which is an extension that allows types to be
constructed bound to a <em>value</em>, e.g. functions with types like
$\tt Array\ n\to Array\ (n+1)$ are possible and it is verified by the
type system that this function will indeed return an array with exactly
one element more for any input given.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Conclusion</h1>
<p>So what do we gain using a type system in the context of software verification?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We know that our program will compile and execute <strong>(catch syntax
errors)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We know that our functions will take and return the intended data
types <strong>(catch violations of our mental model/the designed API)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using advanced type systems we can <strong>control</strong> which functions can
do which <strong>effects</strong> and prevent specific values to be taken out of
<strong>context</strong> (e.g. the Monad typeclass in Haskell)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using dependent types it is even possible to construct types that
prove <strong>almost arbitrary properties</strong>, e.g. to check for
array-out-of-bound errors on compile time or even prove that a
sorting algorithm does indeed return the data sorted</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course the more information the types shall carry, the more
additional work and thought by the developer is required – unfortunately
expressivity comes with a price. To profit from type systems one needs
to have a clear model of the software being developed and one has to
define types which suit the use-case – type annotations are also a form
of formal specification. If every field of an address record is declared
as <code>String</code>, nothing will stop us from using the first name as the
telephone number. Introducing and using different types for distinct
semantic entities, even when they are the same on a low level, can help
to deal with such errors.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this little introduction and that it might have
sparked an interest in type systems, both in theory and practice. The
lambda calculus family and related formal languages are for type
theorists and programming language designers like the Drosophila fly for
biologists - it is small enough to add modifications, study the
resulting entity and prove different properties, but the findings can be
translated and applied to bigger systems in the ‘real world’ and give
software developers new tools to work with, regarding both expressivity
and safety of their code.</p>
