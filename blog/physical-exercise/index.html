            How to Stop Being a Couch Potato
        </h1>

                <li>15th Jul 2023</li><li title="1475 words"><span class='separator' aria-hidden='true'>•</span>8 min read</li><li class="tag"><span class='separator' aria-hidden='true'>•</span>Tags:&nbsp;</li><li class="tag"><a href="https://pirogov.de/tags/personal/">personal</a>,&nbsp;</li><li class="tag"><a href="https://pirogov.de/tags/health/">health</a>,&nbsp;</li><li class="tag"><a href="https://pirogov.de/tags/fitness/">fitness</a></li>
        </ul>

        <section class="body"><p>I consider myself to be not a physically active person. In fact, most of my life I
absolutely <em>hated</em> any kind of exercise. Yet, for about a year now I managed to entertain
a minimal routine for my physical fitness and it is one of the best things I ever did for
myself, and right now I am probably in the best shape I have ever been - I have more
energy and just feel overall much better.</p>
<h2 id="good-for-you-but-how-do-i-even-get-started"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#good-for-you-but-how-do-i-even-get-started" aria-label="Anchor link for: good-for-you-but-how-do-i-even-get-started"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Good for you, but how do I even get started?</h2>
<p>The biggest question that a rehabilitating couch potato, like me, could ask is - how to
motivate yourself? How to get started, and how to actually stick with it? I don’t know if
there is any general answer, as everyone is different. Yet, I can say what lines of
thought worked for me. It boils down to <strong>be brutally honest with yourself and look the most
likely consequences of <em>not</em> doing anything for your body.</strong></p>
<h3 id="pain-and-risk-avoidance-short-and-long-term"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#pain-and-risk-avoidance-short-and-long-term" aria-label="Anchor link for: pain-and-risk-avoidance-short-and-long-term"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Pain and risk Avoidance - short and long Term</h3>
<p>Do you have back pains? I certainly did, since my mid twenties. I also had my first
<a href="/blog/workplace-ergonomics-matters">RSI episode</a> when I was 16, and multiple followed over the years. Do you want these things
to get better, or slowly continue getting worse, until they persistently damage you? Do you
believe that doctors can fix whatever you do to yourself?</p>
<h3 id="observe-your-older-relatives-or-friends"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#observe-your-older-relatives-or-friends" aria-label="Anchor link for: observe-your-older-relatives-or-friends"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Observe your older relatives (or friends)</h3>
<p>How do your (grand-)parents, uncles, aunts and older friends feel? Do they have problems
with their physical health? How much of those problems are caused by an unhealthy
life-style? Are they overweight? Do they have a bad posture? Observe very closely, because
this is your future – demonstrating either a good or a rather bad scenario you might be
moving towards.</p>
<p>While I do feel sorry for certain family members, in a sense I can be thankful to have
anti-role-models to learn about various consequences of bad lifestyle choices and
essentially self-inflicted suffering. Probably you have these examples around you too.</p>
<h3 id="imagine-yourself-being-old"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#imagine-yourself-being-old" aria-label="Anchor link for: imagine-yourself-being-old"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Imagine Yourself Being Old</h3>
<p>We like to forget and push away the fact that also our own body is slowly decaying. The
unforgiving process of aging corrodes us from the inside, so slowly we usually do not
notice until it is too late. Do you want to accelerate the decay, or stop it? What kind of
retirement do you want? Being immobile in front of a TV or computer screen, possibly in a
wheelchair? Or still able to travel around the world? Do you want to steal life years and
quality from your future self, is your current lifestyle really worth it? Don’t you know
that surgeries become more and more dangerous the older you get? Not only you could simply
not survive the surgery itself, you could also get some antibiotic-resistent bacteria for
free. Does this sound like fun you want to have in a few decades?</p>
<h2 id="fine-but-what-am-i-supposed-to-do"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#fine-but-what-am-i-supposed-to-do" aria-label="Anchor link for: fine-but-what-am-i-supposed-to-do"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Fine, but what am I supposed to do?</h2>
<p>Now ideally, you visualized all the horror of being old and in a bad shape, and now
the next question is - what exactly should you do? I tend to become over-excited or
over-motivated, set bars that are too high, grow frustrated and eventually give up. This
is probably the biggest danger that must be avoided. So my answer to the question “how
much?” is: <strong>do as much as you can imagine doing for the rest of your life</strong>.</p>
<p>Yes, the rest of your life. Because once you stop, all progress you possibly made will go
away. You can save up money for retirement, but you can’t do that with your health. Unused
muscle will be absorbed back by your body, because your body is efficient and wants to
save energy. Even worse – damage to joints and bone can be permanent, and recovering all
that is increasingly difficult or impossible as you age. So the best option is to <strong>achieve
a good and sustainable level of physical health, and continuously maintain it</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="treat-daily-exercise-like-brushing-your-teeth"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#treat-daily-exercise-like-brushing-your-teeth" aria-label="Anchor link for: treat-daily-exercise-like-brushing-your-teeth"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Treat daily exercise like brushing your teeth</h3>
<p>As a child, you quickly learned that dentist appointments are usually quite unpleasant.
You probably also eventually learned that brushing and flossing your teeth every day can
make the unavoidable dentist appointment much more bearable, while not doing it can turn
the same appointment into a dreadful experience.</p>
<p>Now my insight was that physical fitness works exactly the same way! Only the time horizon
on which all of that plays out is different, and most people are bad at managing long-term
consequences. While you can neglect your body for 50 years and will only have to pay for it
afterwards, you will probably lose all your teeth much quicker, if you do not take
care of them. But in both cases, <strong>all that is required is just a few minutes each day!</strong></p>
<p><strong>My daily routine is 3-10 minutes</strong>, every day (except for the occasional “lazy day”).
What I do in these few minutes consists of the following building blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>“plank” for 3 minutes (for the abs)</li>
<li>“superman” for 3 minutes (for the back)</li>
<li>10 push-ups (for the arms)</li>
<li>stretching (shoulders, back, legs and hands)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t do all of these items every time, and the time(s) I manage to hold/repeat an
exercise varies. The most important thing is to actually <strong>do a little bit, every day</strong>.
Note that the stretching is also quite important in order to avoid the build-up of painful
tensions.</p>
<h3 id="find-a-kind-of-sports-you-do-not-hate"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#find-a-kind-of-sports-you-do-not-hate" aria-label="Anchor link for: find-a-kind-of-sports-you-do-not-hate"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Find a kind of sports you do not hate</h3>
<p>I have been dancing latin my whole youth, but I stopped during my time in university.
Now I do it again for over a year, once or twice a week, for around 2 hours, and actually
think that I got better than I ever was - because I actually started treating it as
a kind of physical exercise. I can only recommend (competitive) dancing - it is cardio and
a full-body workout at the same time. If you do not sweat or feel exhausted afterwards,
you are doing it wrong.</p>
<p>I think there is no more fun way to get absolutely exhausted than beautifully moving your
body to music. But everyone must find what works for them. Maybe you can get excited about
running, or Capoeira. It might help to choose some activity where you depend on other
people and they depend on you. It is easy to sign up for a gym and never go there, because
there are no consequences. Having a partner or team can help to overcome the hurdle.
<strong>Whatever you do, you should be doing it a few hours a week and it should be somewhat
physically exhausting in order to be effective.</strong></p>
<h3 id="work-on-your-posture"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#work-on-your-posture" aria-label="Anchor link for: work-on-your-posture"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Work on your posture</h3>
<p>Most people have a <strong>bad posture</strong>, often this comes from sitting in chairs front of screens
for half of their day. It not only “looks bad”, it also results in under- and
over-developed back and shoulder muscles, <strong>causing back pain, and possibly even headaches
and migraines</strong>.</p>
<p>Luckily, it is not hard to improve your posture once you set it as a goal. <strong>It is all about
being mindful of the way you sit, stand and walk</strong>. Do some research how the ideal
posture looks like (I am not a fitness instructor and should not try to explain it), and
<strong>regularly look in the mirror</strong> to calibrate.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the healthy and natural posture <em>will</em> feel uncomfortable and
exhausting, as your body is “adapted” to the bad posture. What is actually neutral-looking
will feel like “too much”, because certain muscles are too short or too weak.</p>
<p>Be prepared that this process takes months, and that you will feel tense and strange for a
while, but over time it will start to become more and more natural and effortless to
maintain the correct posture.</p>
<h2 id="last-remarks"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#last-remarks" aria-label="Anchor link for: last-remarks"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Last Remarks</h2>
<p><strong>The three interventions (daily exercise, weekly sports, good posture) are
meant to be combined, no activity can replace the others.</strong>
I have been dancing for a long time, but once I added my core-strength focused daily
exercises, I noticed how my movement quality dramatically improved, due to the additional
core strength.
Conversely, I notice that without the weekly dancing (e.g. after being on vacation)
my stamina is immediately reduced. The longer movement sessions also help to burn some
calories and prevent gaining weight.
Finally, fixing your posture might seem like the most optional suggestion, but only once I
started doing that is when my regular back pains simply stopped.</p>
<p>It all sounds like a lot, but actually most of it are minor interventions -
the daily exercise and posture correction don’t take much time, and luckily, improvements
can be seen rather quickly once you seriously start. So good luck on your own path to more
physical fitness and health!</p>
