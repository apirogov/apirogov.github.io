        <section class="body"><p>Over time I have talked to multiple people who genuinely seem like following some
ritualized approach to software development, such as TDD or Scrum, living by laws such as
“Red, Green, Refactor”, doing “daily stand-ups” or following recipes from some design
pattern bible, either being still in honey moon phase with that idea, or really
believing they found some kind of silver bullet. Maybe it’s just me, but something inside
me automatically revolts whenever some new religion comes up and it’s evangelists start
proselytizing.</p>
<p>Alongside reflections on my own stance concerning software development paradigms and
practices, in the following I try to argue that mechanical usage of any development
approach does not necessarily leads to good results, and that conversely, one can write
perfectly fine software without the constraints of rigid ceremony – at least if you are
the kind of person with enough passion for the craft and who is committed to to
internalizing and following good practice in spirit, if not by letter.</p>
<h2 id="paradigms-are-shadows-of-someone-s-experience"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#paradigms-are-shadows-of-someone-s-experience" aria-label="Anchor link for: paradigms-are-shadows-of-someone-s-experience"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Paradigms are Shadows of Someone’s Experience</h2>
<p>It is well known that software development is both an art and a craft. The craft is, like
any other, only learned by doing, and the art is learned through the experience gained by
doing it for a long time. Nothing replaces having done innumerable stupid things,
exploring many different approaches, and feeling all joy and frustration caused in the
process. <strong>Experience cannot be taught or substituted.</strong></p>
<p>All formalized methodology is an attempt of the creators, usually very senior developers,
to capture the core intuitions and insights they gained and convey the lessons they
learned to others - a mere shadow of someone else’s painfully earned experience, carefully
crafted into a dogma for others to live by.</p>
<p><strong>While you cannot truly teach experience, you can train behavior.</strong> So unlike in biology,
where “form follows function”, here we have that  “function follows form”. The promise of
any methodology or paradigm is: if you follow the steps as you are told, you will end up
with a result that has certain desirable properties, by design.</p>
<p>All these methodologies, paradigms and recipes are social, mental and technical tools,
created to capture and disseminate some good practice or successful pattern - something
that empirically and reproducibly results in high quality output in a suitable
environment. <strong>Each paradigm is an abstraction of someone’s ineffable
practical experience</strong>, their personal glimpse into the Tao of software development,
earned by the daily fight with concrete problems they were solving.
Sadly, these ideas, even if good, often turn into some kind of cult, but probably this is
unavoidable.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-unavoidable_cult-1"><a href="#fn-unavoidable_cult">[1]</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-art-of-picking-the-right-tool-for-the-job"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#the-art-of-picking-the-right-tool-for-the-job" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-art-of-picking-the-right-tool-for-the-job"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
The Art of Picking the Right Tool for the Job</h2>
<p>One popular religion, Scrum, is about managing work, time and communication. TDD is about
consistently creating well-designed, modular and loosely coupled interfaces while ensuring
that they actually work. BDD is about focusing on actual requirements and usability to
guide the design of the system. DDD is about extracting, isolating and shielding the core
of your system from ever-changing requirements and environment parameters, and so on.</p>
<p>People following a dogmatic system too zealously tend to be overjoyed by good experiences
they have, if that system works for them, but miss out on the insights and valuable
lessons of knowing other ways, of feeling the difference and understanding the reason
behind each rule on an intuitive level. <strong>Each methodology has intrinsic costs and
trade-offs</strong>, just like every software it helps us building. Given some problem we want to
solve, the approach or design dictated by someone else’s dogmatic system is</p>
<ul>
<li>not necessarily the best</li>
<li>not the only reasonable option</li>
<li>sometimes not even feasible or useful</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I strongly believe in eclecticism.</strong> Learning from everybody and everything, soaking it
all up. Learning the trade-offs - the good, the bad and the ugly, of every architecture
used for managing code or people, each programming paradigm. Trying not to fall for hypes,
researching all the reasons why it might actually suck, identifying situations where it is
not applicable or actively harmful. As it is often said - don’t use a saw when you need to
put a nail in the wall. When learning some new approach, ask - what is it’s spirit, it’s
essence? What does it try to teach me, what does it offer, is there any evidence? In which
cases can this be useful, and when is it better to stay away? What is the history and
context of it? Try to read the mind of those who came up with it and guess what they
<em>actually</em> wanted to share with us.</p>
<p>Some ideas have been historically and empirically proven to be horrible or naive, and
software development is not only too fast-paced and young, but also much too diverse and
fluid discipline to pin it all down to a few easy to follow rules that almost ensure a
solid result. That is why it is still more of a performance art rather than true
“engineering” discipline, compared to the standardization level and maturity of other
fields.</p>
<p>Yes, we might have “coding standards” and the like, but many conventions and rules we
train ourselves to follow are just workarounds for limitations of often old programming
languages we currently use, so these kind of rules do not count. Often we even
disagree on the set of conventions to use – they vary widely across projects and
programming languages. So what we do <em>not</em> have, are reasonably fail-proof higher order
rules or recipes for building large complex systems that work well and remain maintainable
over long periods of time. Software projects are always a moving target. The closest thing
we have are rough architectural patterns, but even those need very careful consideration.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don’t want it any other way. It makes programming an intrinsically
explorative and creative occupation. If everything was already figured out and the work
could be done by following some human-level algorithm, I would probably rather do other
things with my life. However, I do think that amidst the noise and buzz of the current
trends <strong>there is something timeless and universal to understand, learn and apply</strong>, you
just need to see or intuit it.</p>
<h2 id="universality-of-structural-beauty"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#universality-of-structural-beauty" aria-label="Anchor link for: universality-of-structural-beauty"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Universality of Structural Beauty</h2>
<p>Learning to program is not difficult, like learning to speak and write, so
<strong>people mostly tend to see the linguistic and communicative of code.</strong> That is why we now
have a flood of bootcamp coders who think they became developers by learning some
syntax, while at the same time skilled engineers are a scarce resource.</p>
<p><strong>Software development is less about reading or writing, it is much more about thinking</strong>.
Good prose does not depend on the language it is written in, or format used for printing.
We value it for well-constructed deep thoughts (and feelings), expressed with a masterful,
lucid and creative use of language, whichever the author chose to use. In fact, all other
carrier mediums of art can be seen as just other languages for self-expression - be it
music, paintings, or computer code. <strong>Beauty is in symmetry, beauty is in good structure,
beauty is in balance, beauty is in depth.</strong></p>
<p>I went to university not with the goal of getting a degree, but to learn about computer
science beyond the fun and shiny linguistic interface that programming languages provide.
If my academic education gave me anything of value at all, then it is the ability to
think deeply and clearly, and acquiring a sense and taste for mathematical beauty.</p>
<p>Code is sitting somewhere between natural language and mathematical equations, and I think
we would be all better off approaching programming more akin to mathematicians who
construct beautiful, elegant formalisms and theorems, and less like bad books with
incoherent plots and too many convoluted, but empty words.</p>
<p>There is a nice quote from <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Banach">Banach</a> I
stumbled on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A mathematician is a person who can find analogies between theorems; a better
mathematician is one who can see analogies between proofs and the best mathematician can
notice analogies between theories. One can imagine that the ultimate mathematician is one
who can see analogies between analogies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope you can see the analogy to make this quote equally applicable to developers.</p>
<h2 id="digression-an-ode-to-haskell"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#digression-an-ode-to-haskell" aria-label="Anchor link for: digression-an-ode-to-haskell"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Digression: An Ode to Haskell</h2>
<p><strong>If there is something that had a strong influence on me as a developer except for getting
an academic education and diving into theory, then it was picking up Haskell</strong>. Once you
know a few programming languages, each next language feels easy, mostly like learning new
words for the same things. That is what I thought before I tried to learn Haskell. Haskell
was the first one that really taught me something genuinely, going way deeper than syntax.
It’s like instead of going to a neighboring country, you suddenly find yourself 100 years
into the future exploring a different planet.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time working and fighting with Haskell, and it really is the most
enlightening and still practically usable programming language one can try to learn. I
might be a mediocre Haskell programmer, but I believe it made me a vastly better
programmer in any other language – by breaking my brain and reconfiguring it in new ways.</p>
<p>There are many other languages doing some flavor of FP, but Haskell is so much more than
that – due to its exceptionally powerful type system and the abstractions it enables. It
is the only language I know that is actually suitable and used for real-world problems and
at the same time can still feel like doing abstract math. <strong>It is beautiful, and still full
of ideas that very slowly, over decades, leak into mainstream languages.</strong> Usually under
some less scary names, in simplified more easily digestible form they are re-discovered or
absorbed by the mainstream:</p>
<ul>
<li>addition of lambdas as primitives (for frictionless function composition)</li>
<li>the rise of general higher order combinators, such as maps, folds, zips</li>
<li>optional type, instead of using null values (the Maybe type)</li>
<li>variant types, instead of cumbersome ad-hoc visitor patterns (the Either type)</li>
<li>futures and promises as special common cases of abstract monadic computation</li>
<li>powerful mechanisms for parametric polymorphism (“generics”, “templates”)</li>
<li>preference of generic function and type composition over inheritance</li>
<li>preference of immutable structures and isolation of mutable state</li>
<li>preference of controlling side effects and separating them from pure functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Just to mention a few examples. Most concepts that get adopted have a good power-to-weight
ratio, apparently sitting at some sweetspot between simplicity and near-universal
applicability.</p>
<p>Sure, Haskell has its downsides, difficulties, design flaws as well – try to insert a
harmless print statement in a random place, or understanding memory consumption. It
probably will never leave the niche it comfortably sits in, and it does not want
to<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-success-1"><a href="#fn-success">[2]</a></sup>. <strong>Just like Jodorowsky’s Dune movie that was never made, Haskell is the most
influential programming language that almost nobody ever used</strong>, but that already affected
dozens of modern popular languages and enlightened generations of receptive developers.
What could be a bigger success?</p>
<h2 id="the-oop-vs-fp-war-is-over-and-everybody-won"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#the-oop-vs-fp-war-is-over-and-everybody-won" aria-label="Anchor link for: the-oop-vs-fp-war-is-over-and-everybody-won"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
The OOP vs. FP war is over, and everybody won</h2>
<p>I’ve seen some of the fruit and read enough stories of classical, deeply inheritance-based
<strong>OOP</strong>, manifested in the most pure form in Java. <strong>It is a naive idea: taking the
common-sense way of conceptualizing the world, and trying to mimic it in code.</strong> But the
real world is a mess and hard to reason about, so that is exactly what we get: a messy
entangled global state of interacting entities, the nightmare of our own making. It looks
like the world agrees by now that this idea has failed miserably.</p>
<p><strong>FP</strong>, on the other hand, is more mathematical in its very nature - you break the world
down to atoms, simple building bricks of computation. Like physicists, who capture the
essence and dynamics of the universe in a bunch of equations concerning some dozen of
fields, by uncovering and exploiting the underlying symmetries and surprising homogenity
and predictability underlying all the mess we see at the macro level, they have long
figured out that <strong>the global dynamics emerges from a myriad of simple local interactions,
each individually perfectly understood and transparent</strong> (or very close to that).</p>
<p><strong>Modern OOP</strong>, as it is preached and practiced these days, has been mostly stripped of
it’s naive assumptions and blunders, teaching to use composition over inheritance, keep
entanglement between objects low, and thinking more about clear ownership of data. <strong>Either
on purpose or by some accidental conceptual convergence, this tamed and revised form of
OOP is actually pretty close to being FP, presented in object-shaped clothing.</strong> The main
difference is the emphasis remaining on the data entities over the operations, whereas the
FP perspective naturally does the opposite - usually emphasizing functions consuming
abstract generic interfaces, instead of concrete data types.</p>
<p>Both views have value, in fact - they are complementary. There is data, and there is code.
Sometimes they are even one and the same and barely distinguishable (that lesson and it’s
power best taught by Lisp), whereas sometimes we prefer to create more rigid boundaries
(embodied by languages with strong and expressive type eystems). <strong>Both perspectives are
equally important and must be balanced in order to achieve our <em>actual</em> goals.</strong>
What we all want is to write less code that does more, code that has elusive qualities
such as <em>“loose coupling, but high cohesion”</em>, which is just fancy OOP slang to express
our desire for:</p>
<ul>
<li>simplicity (small and obvious pieces that are almost trivially correct)</li>
<li>generality (you can use pieces in many contexts)</li>
<li>modularity (you can use pieces in isolation)</li>
<li>composability (you can build many different things with the pieces you have)</li>
</ul>
<p>In a system with these properties, functions and data structures are like razor-sharp
tools of haiku-like beauty. I believe that code written like this is naturally closer to
mathematics, closer to theoretical computer science.</p>
<p><strong>The code best exemplifying all these ideals can often be found in standard libraries.</strong>
What code is more atomic, generic and composable and modular than the vocabulary the
language creators provide to the masses of developers building all the required systems
for practical tasks? And which developers are more qualified and experienced than those
creating programming languages and writing powerful libraries? If you want to know how to
write well-designed software, good standard libraries are a place to start learning.</p>

The one true method(tm) - aggressive abstraction</h1>
<p>I find the cage of routine, dogma and ceremony to be repulsive, but I believe I do have a
thing that is some kind of an intuitive methodology. When I approach a problem, I do the
theoretician’s trick - <strong>try to generalize, solve the simpler general problem, then
specialize to your concrete context and fill in missing details</strong>. It is just the
recursive use of tasteful abstraction, which can be described interchangeably as:</p>
<ul>
<li>aggressively identifying recurring patterns and unifying them</li>
<li>compressing information, while reducing or externalizing noise</li>
<li>decreasing the “entropy” of the system, while increasing its “potential energy”</li>
</ul>
<p>I try to do this across all the levels and scopes of a project, manifesting this as:</p>
<ul>
<li>pretending to build a meta software for that kind of problem I have, instead of coming up with a one-off solution for a singular problem</li>
<li>pretending to write code for a generic library or framework, even if the code will most likely never leave that project</li>
<li>actually refactoring out a (possibly internal) library, if there is something of more general value that could be reused</li>
<li>thinking in terms of generic, small, simple functions and data types with good properties (as discussed further above)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you get used to thinking like this, you naturally gravitate toward code that is easy
to test, understand, reuse, (de-)compose and extend.</strong> All of this boils down to
performing the creative art of finding the maximal level of abstraction that is useful at
any given level, but not more than that.</p>
<p><strong>The process involves throwing away as many details as possible that obstruct the view of
the big picture</strong>, clearly identifying invariants and symmetries and dependencies, and
adding as many degrees of freedom as possible, reducing the number of needed assumptions
and constants coming from practical requirements and externalizing them to parameters.
Maybe this can be seen as a vast generalization of the SOLID principles, which are
both consistent with and I believe quite naturally follow from this way of thinking.</p>
<p>The art of abstraction is where pure mathematicians tend to excel at, but of course, <strong>there
is also some risk of falling into the trap of over-abstraction</strong> - when your general
solution has so many parameters and moving parts that it looks not simpler and more
managable, but more convoluted and complicated. This means that you missed the right point
to stop. Even abstraction, the most powerful cognitive tool humanity ever created and
perfected, is still just a tool. It should not be fetishized, and requires some taste and
experience. As usual, everything is only good in moderation, and only if approached with
healthy pragmaticism.</p>
<p>We are not abstracting just for the sake of it or for showing off, but with the goal of
finding a clean, elegant, well designed and reasonable solution to a concrete problem we
face. <strong>A true virtuoso must know when to indulge in some fancy wizardry, and when it is
best to stick with something simple and straight-forward.</strong> Just like a good musician could
solo all day, but will humbly play and stick to a basic melody or rhythm, if that is what
the song or band needs.</p>
<h1 id="how-i-usually-write-software-in-practice"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#how-i-usually-write-software-in-practice" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-i-usually-write-software-in-practice"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
How I usually write software in practice</h1>
<p>When I sit down to solve some fresh problem from scratch, after understanding the most
important side constraints and true requirements, I try to break it down, come up with
nice loosely coupled building blocks, starting from sketches of bigger components and
subsystems, then decomposing those subsystems down to focused, small functions and data
types. I might draw some conceptual sketches and type signatures on a whiteboard or paper.</p>
<p>Then, piece by piece, I start writing out the functions and structures, more or less
simultaneously encoding my intentions and assumptions about their behavior in unit tests.
All of this is then semi-consciously mapped to idioms and constraints of a programming
language that I have to or choose to use, balancing the style and patterns the language
was designed for (as far as I am aware of them), and my own tastes and preferences.</p>
<p>If I can, I extensively use a REPL to interact with pieces of code. It keeps the gap
between mental model and concrete implementation as small as possible, the code becomes
more tangible - almost like a physical object. If I do an experiment often enough to
notice and be annoyed by a pattern, it’s time to pin it down as an automated test. If I
have no REPL, I use a test framework as a poor person’s REPL, writing out and evaluating
my exploratory interactions with the function I am writing in pseudo test cases, later
shaping and refining them into proper tests that check all relevant edge cases and
invariants.</p>
<p>At no point of all this I use any trendy methodology, or follow any rigid disciplined
approach or ritualized practice that has an established label. In fact, I feel that any
rigid routine is very quickly not an aid, but a cage. Maybe a well-intentioned cage, but
still a cage nonetheless. Fixed paradigms that someone else created are, to loosely quote
Wittgenstein, the ladder that you need to use just once, in order to get to some elevated,
difficult to reach place. The ladder becomes obsolete and can be thrown away once you
attain the insights you can get from the new vantage point.</p>
<p><strong>Once you internalize the essence of a concept, it becomes a part of your thinking, a
part of your being.</strong> You learn to voluntarily stay within the constraints outlined by a
useful conceptual framework, but stay open minded to recognize situations when breaking
some rules or following other rules is the better option.</p>
<p>Am I any good at all this? I don’t know, I think I’m doing fine and hope that I am getting
better over time. What I think I <em>do</em> know for sure is where the light is, and I always
try to reach towards it. Once you start believing you are already <em>there</em>, you stop
learning and growing. All I can hope is that code I write next year is better than last
year, and that I can gracefully look back at code from last year, forgive myself, and be
thankful that I apparently have evolved. I guess, another implicit rule I follow is: <strong>try
to write code that future-you will not be ashamed of or hate you for.</strong></p>
<h1 id="programming-is-the-closest-substitute-for-magic"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#programming-is-the-closest-substitute-for-magic" aria-label="Anchor link for: programming-is-the-closest-substitute-for-magic"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Programming is the closest substitute for Magic</h1>
<p>When I am absorbed in the process of creation, the only rule I follow is my gut feeling,
intuition, and desire for crystalline mathematical beauty of well-crafted structure,
reflected in the virtues of good code discussed above. It all just naturally flows - from
the ephemeral platonic realm of perfect concepts and ideas, channelled and filtered by my
imperfect thoughts, tainted by the mess and incidental complexity of real world problems
and constraints, and finally projected out, pouring the spirit that came ex nihilo, right
into the silicon flesh in our physical realm - executable code on a hard drive, created to
do something useful.</p>
<p>Probably it is the closest we can ever get to the fantasy of wielding supernatural powers
and using powerful magic spells that can bring a golem to life. For me, tapping into the
mathematical void, source of all abstraction and creation, channeling and shaping it to
manifest something new in the world that unifies both beauty and value - this is all the
joy and bliss of software development.</p>
<p>Now the somewhat amusing punchline, and starting point for thinking about all this, was
that the typical outcome of my intuitive “abstraction driven design” process is
probably not too different, maybe even observationally indistinguishable, from results
that others would achieve with TDD and other more formalized approaches. Which, I guess,
confirms that these approaches, when used correctly, <em>are actually working pretty well!</em>
I just prefer staying a liberal agnostic and really dislike any kind of orthodoxy, that is
all.</p>
<p>So closing on a less serious note - to not appear to others as a wild and uncivilized
barbarian, I figured that when talking to other people, maybe I should say: <em>yes,
in fact I also do some form of “TDD”!</em> Only without mentioning that the “T” in my personal
“TDD” is not for “Testing”, but for “Tao” – because I intuitively follow the Tao of
structural beauty and tasteful abstraction. If the results are decent enough, who will be
able to tell the difference?</p>
