Abstract</h1>
<p><em>After completing my PhD, I have worked now for almost three years as a software developer
in a research center. I took that job naively hoping that I can support science with what
I believe I can do best – solving challenging technical problems and writing code. I did
quite some of that, but also witnessed and have been exposed to more of the broken inner
workings of the academic system than I ever signed up for. In this rant-y essay I reflect
on my personal disappointment with what I have seen and explaining why I am now in the
process of leaving this environment for good, finally closing this chapter of my life.</em></p>
<p><em>I am aware that some issues are currently in the process of being addressed and will
hopefully be resolved, or at least improve over time. I wish everyone involved in the
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://researchsoftware.org/">RSE</a> community all the best and a lot of endurance, hoping
that they are able to achieve improvements with respect to the perceived value of and
perspectives for professional software developers who choose to work in science. But
cultural and institutional change is very slow. Maybe 10 or 20 years from now everything
will look much better, but I have neither the patience nor desire or hope to bet my career
on it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> All of the following is a biased personal and emotionally colored view –
a single sample point – and not representative of all scientific fields, communities or
organizations. Furthermore, most people I have had the pleasure of working with were
highly motivated, hard-working and idealistic people – who actually suffer from all of
these problems. The systemic issues are well-known, and of course it’s not all black and
white, even though the following might read more black-ish. For more nuanced and less
emotional perspectives on research software engineering, check out e.g.

Academic Politics: Optimizing For Visibility and Prestige</h1>
<p>The people in positions of authority and seniority in science got where they are because
they are very good in at least one of the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>their scientific domain <em>(ideally, but even that is sadly not always the case)</em></li>
<li>writing smart-sounding papers <em>(i.e. convince others they found knowledge)</em></li>
<li>getting funding for awesome-looking projects <em>(i.e. selling big visions)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>What is <strong>not</strong> measured by the sticks used in the performance evaluation of a
scientist, principal investigator, professor, etc., are for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>the sustainability and reusability of the work that has been done</li>
<li>the quality and actual practical usefulness of the produced output</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What counts most in science is that there is a nice publication or project report at the
end – another citation with the names of the authors to fulfil the required quota.</strong>
Published text, and some nice presentations – this is the interface between the
people doing the work and the people giving out the money.</p>
<p>As the vast majority of scientific output consists of novel ideas and prototypes, and
often the topics are so deep that proper evaluation is barely feasible, the game is biased
in such a way that <strong>presentation and appearance is often much more important for success
than the actual merit of the work</strong>. This, of course, is not how science is supposed to
function, but the current global academic environment adapted to the metrics it has been
subjected to. It developed elaborate methods for <strong>producing quantity over quality, and a
lot of hot air sold in huge, shiny balloons</strong>.</p>
<p>This is an art that some bad actors seem to have perfected in order stay afloat, and this
puts everyone who tries to do <strong>actual good work</strong> at an evolutionary disadvantage in this
brutal competition for so-called excellence and reputation. <strong>If appearance is enough to
survive, all extra work is wasted energy, and is better used to produce more appearance.</strong></p>
<p>To get funding, you usually need to frame your work as something <em>novel</em>, something
<em>grand</em> and <em>inspiring</em>. It is much easier to get money for “innovative” projects that</p>
<ul>
<li>try to apply experimental approaches <em>(not battle-tested, often questionable)</em></li>
<li>use exotic convoluted technology <em>(created + mindlessly promoted in academia)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>than it is to get money for important but more “boring” things such as</p>
<ul>
<li>creating small useful tools that help people in a scientific field <br /> <em>(e.g. solving a small but common problem they face in the daily work)</em></li>
<li>maintaining and incrementally improving existing systems <br /> <em>(unless the improvement is super-visible, making it worthy of a paper)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There is often not much of an incentive to find the most useful, practical and technically
feasible solution, instead <strong>a lot of incentive to sell snake-oil and deliver half-assed
prototypes</strong>. And if getting money for a project is not already difficult enough, you need
to work around political requirements and landmines, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>everyone wanting to put their names and logo on the project<br /> <em>(if we can’t, please reinvent the wheel for us – i.e. classic NIH syndrome)</em></li>
<li>some big guys doing very similar things but disliking each other<br /> <em>(so you need to avoid them, instead of joining forces)</em></li>
</ul>

Software Development In Adverse Conditions</h1>
<p>If you are a software developer and take a position in some academic institution,
unless you took a job in some central administration / infrastructure department – let us
ignore this special and quite different case – then…</p>
<ol>
<li>you might be the only skilled developer in an otherwise non-developer team</li>
<li>the people you report to probably have no idea how to manage software projects</li>
<li>your contract is almost certainly funded by a 3rd party project and is temporary</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following sections I unpack these points and explain the problems they imply.</p>
<h2 id="lone-wolves-of-academia-unite"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#lone-wolves-of-academia-unite" aria-label="Anchor link for: lone-wolves-of-academia-unite"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Lone Wolves of Academia, Unite!</h2>
<p><strong>Software development is the creative team sport of effectively building complex systems
that work correctly and reliably over longer periods of time.</strong> Being the only developer
working on a project in your unit, or being a too small team for the scale of the
project – this is a <em>massive</em> problem, as it limits the kind of the projects you can
successfully complete.</p>
<p>There is a limit to the size of a project a lone warrior developer
can handle. It works well enough for small tools, but it does not scale to large, complex
software – at least not if you want to get things done in reasonable time. So for bigger
projects you will be often working in loose collaboration with other people, who are
employed at unrelated institutions, each of them with different agendas, priorities and
paths of decision making. <strong>Welcome to the nightmare of diffused responsibility and lack
of accountability.</strong> <sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-1-1"><a href="#fn-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Working in a distributed team of developers might have its intrinsic challenges, but those
can be and are overcome – under the assumption of a coherent organization, e.g. managed
within the same company or institution. But the kind of loose and promiscuous project
collaboration as practiced between academic institutions, while maybe working well for
doing some research together and ensuring fruitful exchange of ideas, makes it very
difficult to effectively work on a complex piece of software together, unless the majority
of work is managed and done at one place and only minor tasks are offloaded to motivated
external contributors.</p>
<p><strong>Academic software development works like (and often actually is) open source development
– it is based on voluntary, unstable and barely uncoordinated investment of work and
time, driven by the self-interest of contributors.</strong> But a successful open source project
might have tens of thousands of stars on GitHub and dozens of enthusiastic contributors,
whereas the popularity of your average work project in academia will be closer to that of
your average personal toy projects, and will have similar difficulties in getting any
attention. If you don’t have at least <em>a few</em> developers in your team you can really count
on, good luck.</p>
<h2 id="software-project-management-scientific-management"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#software-project-management-scientific-management" aria-label="Anchor link for: software-project-management-scientific-management"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Software Project Management != Scientific Management</h2>
<p>Science is pretty good in finding and walking the paths less travelled and discovering new
and unexpected places. However, <strong>what science is exceptionally bad at is building a nice,
straight, cemented road that others can use in order to arrive somewhere they actually
wanted to go.</strong></p>
<p>The people getting money and taking decisions very well understand the game of academia,
but they usually have no clue about product development and team management as it is
needed for larger software development efforts. Scientists, on any level, are not used to
breaking down big projects into realistic milestones, distributing work and setting
priorities wisely. The scale and required investment for a complex software is simply much
larger than the average research project that just is expected to produce a paper or two
in the end.</p>
<p>Because non-technical staff manages technical staff, work is often distributed
ineffectively. They simply do not know what a single developer is capable of, and what the
individual strengths of the available people are. And beyond vague project goals, there
are rarely clear requirements – another <em>massive</em> problem.</p>
<p>If you are told to build a bridge, but not really from where to where, for which purpose,
how much material you can use, how much load it needs to carry and what other constraints
need to be satisfied – what kind of solution should you design? If your assignment is to
“build a big bridge that can carry a lot of traffic”, what is even a proper measurement of
success?
A very imprecise way of stating requirements or planning projects is often even done <em>by
design</em>, because if you do not say what “big” and “a lot” means when you apply for
funding, you can define it in your progress report later in such a way that it perfectly fits
what has been done so far.</p>
<p><strong>So this is the cheap trick often used to ensure that almost every project in academia
ends up being a success (at least on paper): You first shoot the arrow, and then you say
that whatever you hit was the target all along.</strong> It really does work roughly like in that
old joke. Your funding proposal basically just needs to say: “We are going to shoot an
arrow into a well-chosen direction” and your final report will say that “after a lot of
deliberation we settled on a promising direction, identified a suitable target and
successfully hit it with our arrow, proving the efficacy of our arrow-shooting device”.
Piece of cake.</p>
<p>So they just want you to figure something out, come up with something that sounds
reasonable and can be tried out – the same way you just give a promising idea to a PhD
student to let them work it out until they can write a paper or thesis about it that
somehow fits the initially planned topic. Only that you often have absolutely no clue
about the domain of people you try to build your solutions for, so you cannot do the
requirement engineering properly, and end up building <em>something</em> that <em>might</em>,
possibly, hopefully, make some sense and help the people it is intended for.</p>
<p><strong>If the requirements are not made clear enough, it is impossible to fail on paper, but it
is also impossible to succeed in real life and come up with a useful solution.</strong> And the
truth is, your actual solution often does not really matter all that much, because nobody
really cares anyway.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-2-1"><a href="#fn-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>There is rarely a person combining the authority, expertise enough time and the
willingness to take on the “product owner” role of a larger software project in order to
push and guide it towards a genuine success. Usually, your manager will already be busy…</p>
<ul>
<li>getting more external collaborators on board and motivating them to contribute</li>
<li>writing reports that say how awesome the project is and how well it is going</li>
<li>trying to secure more funding to keep you around, or get some more developers</li>
</ul>
<p>In the meantime, feel free to build small and big bridges all over the place the way you
see fit. They will just observe which bridges end up being used and try to get more
funding for them. Wait – does that remind you of something? Yes, that’s right – this is
how research is typically done. <strong>Invent interesting solutions, then look for problems they
might solve, and find people who might care about it.</strong></p>

The Persistence of Volatility</h2>
<p>Now consider all of the problems above, and multiply them by the fact that your position
is not permanent, as is the position of most employees in your institution, as is the
position of the majority of people doing the actual down-to-earth work in science.</p>
<p>A scientist can hope to eventually get a permanent position and live happily ever after.
But a software developer in science – what is this? <strong>There are effectively no
predictable career paths for highly qualified technical (but non-scientific) staff in
science</strong>, and only few institutions afford to even have some larger technical department
of people doing de-novo software development (in contrast to, e.g., maintenance of
existing infrastructural software, such as digital libraries).</p>
<p>So most software in science is developed by small, often highly distributed groups of
people, who are often not even trained to be developers or maintainers of a software
project and most likely will not be around in a few years. <strong>The instability of the
employment of people who write and maintain code directly affects the long-time
health and viability of that code.</strong> It is a well known, still mostly unsolved problem
that software projects in research tend to die soon after the one or the few critical
people who were taking care of it move to a different project or leave academia
altogether. <strong>Most software projects in research have a bus factor of 1.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And it is on top of this fragile house of cards consisting of barely maintained eternal
prototypes where a lot of cutting-edge research is being done.</strong> If you hear this the first
time and this does not give you a sense shock and existential dread, then I do not know
what will. Academia simply has no tools or mechanisms in place to ensure successful and
reliable development and operation of complex software on time scales going beyond 3-5
years<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-3-1"><a href="#fn-3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<h1 id="summary"><a class="header-anchor no-hover-padding" href="#summary" aria-label="Anchor link for: summary"><span class="link-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
Summary</h1>
<p>Over the last three years I went through one stage of disillusionment after the other. I
guess I went through something like a quarter-life crisis, and I think that I
came out as a more adult and less naive person – both in good ways and in bad ways. The
first-hand glimpses I got of the plumbing and machinery of academia taught me a lot about
people, large organizations and politics overall. And lately, I have been standing at the
bifurcation of two paths. The key question determining my future path being – am I
willing to sacrifice myself to make a tiny dent in this ugly gigantic mess called
academia, could I be content by just imagining that I gave it a very little nudge
into the right direction?</p>
<p>Do I have enough idealism, resilience and hope for science that I could learn to accept and
live with the rules of the game which cannot be easily changed, to stay in this environment,
trying to make the best out of it? Or do I rather accept the reality that the idealized,
romantic idea of science is not at all how the real world works, probably never was, and
most likely never will be?</p>
<p><strong>One day I woke up and my gut feeling told me that the penny has dropped. I simply did
not care anymore.</strong> And this moment I knew that it is time to move on. This environment
does not really value my qualification and skills, and it does not offer me any
perspectives for development or growth. The intrinsic passion for science (as a “social
institution”) that I once had is now gone for good, and I know that the longer I would
stay in this swamp, the more bitter, cynical and emotionally divested I would become. My
technical abilities would slowly wither, lacking the right kind of challenge and
motivation, and eventually I would end up being a hollow shell, either stuck forever in
this cursed quicksand, or eventually spat out onto the street, emotionally drained and now
also old and useless for the so-called <em>industry</em>, after wasting too many years too close
to the ivory towers.</p>
<p>Once the system completely lost all the remaining magical flair of almost holy
transcendence, walking the path of the idealistic martyr completely lost its appeal for
me. All these causes looking like something to live and die for end up being mirages and
lies. So probably it should be not very surprising to find that <strong>when all illusions are
stripped away, science is not much different from the rest of the world and just as ugly –
narcissistic people playing games of power and glory, while riding on the back of selfless
people with the right mix of helper and Stockholm syndrome.</strong></p>
<p>No, all the insanity of academia cannot be solved by any kind of software, while at
the same time creating actually <em>useful</em> software for any purpose is nearly impossible in
this dysfunctional environment<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-4-1"><a href="#fn-4">[4]</a></sup>. I, for one, have seen enough. So academia, consider
that a divorce!</p>
<hr><ol class="footnotes-list">

<p>If you have a coherent team of collaborating developers, consider yourself lucky! <a href="#fr-1-1">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-2">
<p>Sure, you can try to ask and clarify requirements. But your managers cannot give you
more information or insight, because they do not have any more to share. The PhD
students and PostDocs are too busy writing papers and doing research – they have no
time to explain their work or problems to you (if they are even aware of any problems).
To make it even more fun, they also do not really understand what you are trying to do,
and how it is supposed to help them. You thought you’ll be a celebrated hero and
savior by coming as a developer into a research institute? <em>Hahaha!</em> <a href="#fr-2-1">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-3">
<p>3-5 years is what you could get with an initial funding and an eventual follow-up
funding, if you even get this far, to hire and allocate developers to some project.
After that, most projects lose momentum and simply fade back into obscurity,
until they are abandoned and forgotten, just like your average toy project on GitHub. <a href="#fr-3-1">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-4">
<p>All of this applies to the “applied sciences”. Compared to the rest, theoreticians
are the good-hearted tree-hugging hippies of science – I choose to hold on to that
belief. I did my PhD as such a hippie, and now almost wish I could unsee all the ugly
things outside the little bubble where I have been academically socialized in. Maybe
the amount of decay in science correlates with the size of the field and amount of
money and glamour in it. Hardcore theory is for the few passionate ones who do not
care too much about such things. <a href="#fr-4-1">↩</a></p>
